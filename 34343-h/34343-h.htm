<h2>THE BETROTHAL; OR THE BLUE BIRD CHOOSES</h2>



<h3>ACT I</h3>


<h3><a name="SCENE_I" id="SCENE_I"></a>SCENE I</h3>


<blockquote><p><i>The Wood-cutter's Cottage</i></p>

<p><i>The cottage-scene in The Blue Bird: the interior of a
wood-cutter's cabin, simple and rustic in appearance, but in no way
poverty-stricken. A recessed fireplace containing the dying embers
of a wood-fire. Kitchen-utensils, a cupboard, a bread-pan, a
grandfather's clock, a spinning-wheel, a water-tap, etc. A dog and
a cat asleep. A large blue-and-white sugar-loaf. On the wall hangs
a round cage containing a blue bird. At the back, two windows with
closed shutters. On the left is the front-door, with a big latch to
it. A ladder leads up to a loft. But there is only one bed</i>,
TYLTYL'S; <i>he is now sixteen years of age. It is dark; the scene is
lit only by a few moonbeams which filter through the shutters</i>.
TYLTYL <i>is sound asleep</i>.</p>

<p>(<i>A knock at the door</i>.) </p></blockquote>

<p>TYLTYL</p>

<p>(<i>Waking with a start</i>.) Who's there? (<i>Another knock</i>.) Wait till I put
on my breeches. The door's bolted. I'll come and open it.</p>

<p>THE FAIRY</p>

<p>(<i>Behind the door.</i>) Don't trouble, don't trouble!... It's only me!...
How do you do? (<i>The door has opened of its own accord and</i> THE FAIRY
BÉRYLUNE <i>enters under the guise of an old woman, as in the first scene
of the Blue Bird. At the same time the room is filled with a strange
brightness, which remains after the door is closed again</i>.)</p>

<p>TYLTYL</p>

<p>(<i>In surprise</i>.) Who are you?</p>

<p>THE FAIRY</p>

<p>Don't you know me? Why, Tyltyl, it's hardly seven years since we said
good-bye to each other!</p>

<p>TYLTYL</p>

<p>(<i>Bewildered and vainly searching his memory</i>.) Yes, yes, I remember ...
and I know what you mean....</p>

<p>THE FAIRY</p>

<p>Yes, but you don't quite grasp who I am and you don't remember anything
at all. You haven't changed, I see: just the same careless, ungrateful,
wool-gathering little fellow that you always were!... But you have grown
taller and stronger, my lad, and quite handsome! If I were not a fairy,
I should never have known you! Yes, really quite handsome!... But are
you aware of it? It doesn't seem to have occurred to you!</p>

<p>TYLTYL</p>

<p>We only had one tiny looking-glass in the house, about as big as your
hand. Mytyl took it and keeps it in her room.</p>

<p>THE FAIRY</p>

<p>So Mytyl has a room of her own now?</p>

<p>TYLTYL</p>

<p>Yes, she sleeps next door, under the stairs, and I here, in the kitchen.
Shall I wake her?</p>

<p>THE FAIRY</p>

<p>(<i>Growing suddenly and unreasonably angry, as on her former visit</i>.)
There's no need to do anything of the sort!... I have nothing to do with
her; her hour has not struck; and, when it does I shall be quite capable
of finding her, without being shown the way as though I were blind!...
In the meantime, I want nobody's advice....</p>

<p>TYLTYL</p>

<p>(<i>In dismay</i>.) But ma'am, I didn't know....</p>

<p>THE FAIRY</p>

<p>That will do.... (<i>Recovering her temper as suddenly as she lost it</i>.)
By the way, how old are you?</p>

<p>TYLTYL</p>

<p>I shall be sixteen a fortnight after Epiphany.</p>

<p>THE FAIRY</p>

<p>(<i>Growing angry again</i>.) A fortnight after Epiphany!... What a way of
reckoning!... And here am I without my almanack, having left it with
Destiny last time I called on him, fifty years ago!... I don't know
where I stand.... However, never mind: I'll make the calculation when we
see him, for we shall have to get it exactly right.... And what have you
been doing these seven years since we met?</p>

<p>TYLTYL</p>

<p>I have been working in the forest with daddy.</p>

<p>THE FAIRY</p>

<p>That means you've been helping him cut down trees. I don't like that
very much. You call that working, do you? Ah, well, men evidently can't
live without destroying the last things of beauty that remain on the
earth!... So let's talk of something else.... (<i>Mysteriously</i>.) Can any
one hear us?</p>

<p>TYLTYL</p>

<p>I don't think so.</p>

<p>THE FAIRY</p>

<p>(<i>Growing angry once more</i>.) It doesn't matter what you think, but
whether you're sure. What I have to say is tremendously important ...
and strictly private. Come here, quite close, so that I can whisper
it.... Whom are you in love with?</p>

<p>TYLTYL</p>

<p>(<i>In amazement</i>.) Whom am I in love with?</p>

<p>THE FAIRY</p>

<p>(<i>Still cross and quite forgetting the importance of speaking in a low
voice</i>.) Yes, yes! I'm not talking Greek, am I? I want to know if you're
in love with any one.</p>

<p>TYLTYL</p>

<p>Yes, certainly; I love everybody: my parents, my friends, my sister, my
neighbours, all the people I know.</p>

<p>THE FAIRY</p>

<p>Now oblige me and don't play the fool.... You know perfectly well what I
mean.... I'm asking whether there's any one girl among those you meet
whom you love more than the rest.</p>

<p>TYLTYL</p>

<p>(<i>Blushing and considering</i>.) I don't know....</p>

<p>THE FAIRY</p>

<p>(<i>Angrier than ever</i>.) What do you mean; you don't know? Who does know,
if you don't? At your age a boy ought to think of nothing else: if he
doesn't, he's a booby, a nincompoop and not worth bothering about!...
There's nothing to blush at: it's when one's not in love that one should
feel ashamed.... You and I are miles away just now from the falsehood of
words: we are with the truth of our thoughts, which is a very different
thing.... Come, among all the girls you've met....</p>

<p>TYLTYL</p>

<p>(<i>Timidly</i>.) I don't meet very many....</p>

<p>THE FAIRY</p>

<p>That's no reason; it's not necessary to meet them by the dozen. Very
often it's enough if you come across just one: when you've nobody else,
you love that one and are not to be pitied.... But come, among those
close by....</p>

<p>TYLTYL</p>

<p>There aren't any close by....</p>

<p>THE FAIRY</p>

<p>There are at the neighbours'.</p>

<p>TYLTYL</p>

<p>There are hardly any neighbours....</p>

<p>THE FAIRY</p>

<p>There are girls in the village, in the town, way back in the forest and
in every house. You find them everywhere when your heart's awake....
Which is the prettiest?</p>

<p>TYLTYL</p>

<p>Well, they're all very pretty.</p>

<p>THE FAIRY</p>

<p>How many do you know?</p>

<p>TYLTYL</p>

<p>Four in the village, one in the forest and one by the bridge.</p>

<p>THE FAIRY</p>

<p>Oho! That's not bad, for a beginning!</p>

<p>TYLTYL</p>

<p>We don't see many people here, you know.</p>

<p>THE FAIRY</p>

<p>You're not the baby one would think.... But tell me, between ourselves,
do they love you too?</p>

<p>TYLTYL</p>

<p>They haven't told me so; they don't know that I love them.</p>

<p>THE FAIRY</p>

<p>But these are things which it isn't necessary to know or to tell!... You
see that at once when you're living in the truth. A look is enough;
there's no mistaking it; and the words which people say merely hide the
real ones which the heart has spoken.... But I'm in a hurry: would you
like me to make them come here?</p>

<p>TYLTYL</p>

<p>(<i>Terrified</i>.) Make them come here? They wouldn't want to! They hardly
know me. They know I'm poor. They don't know where I live, especially
those in the village: they never come this way.... It's an hour's walk
from the church to the house; the roads are bad; it's dark....</p>

<p>THE FAIRY</p>

<p>Dear, dear, anything more? Don't let us talk about that. Remember, we've
done with untruths. I've only to lift my finger and they'll come....</p>

<p>TYLTYL</p>

<p>But I'm not even sure that they've noticed me at all.</p>

<p>THE FAIRY</p>

<p>Have you looked at them?</p>

<p>TYLTYL</p>

<p>Yes, sometimes....</p>

<p>THE FAIRY</p>

<p>And have they looked back at you?</p>

<p>TYLTYL</p>

<p>Yes, sometimes....</p>

<p>THE FAIRY</p>

<p>Well, that's enough; that's the truth; and one doesn't need anything
more. You'll find that's the way people tell each other in the world
where I'm going to take you, the world of real things. The rest doesn't
matter.... They make no mistake. You'll see, once we are there, how well
they know all that has to be known; for what we see is nothing: it is
what we do not see that makes the world go round.... And now, watch
me!... I'm taking the little green hat out of my bag again!... Do you
remember it?</p>

<p>TYLTYL</p>

<p>Yes, but it's bigger....</p>

<p>THE FAIRY</p>

<p>(<i>Angrily</i>.) Of course it's bigger! So's your head: they grew up
together.... Always making those unnecessary remarks!...</p>

<p>TYLTYL</p>

<p>And the diamond has changed colour. I should call it blue....</p>

<p>THE FAIRY</p>

<p>But, you see, it isn't the diamond! This time we're not concerned with
the souls of Bread, Sugar and other simple and unimportant things. We
have to choose the great and only love of your life; for each man has
only one. If he misses it, he wanders miserably over the face of the
earth. The search goes on till he dies, with the great duty unfulfilled
which he owes to all those who are within him. But he seldom has an idea
of this. He walks along, his eyes shut; seizes some woman whom he
chances to meet in the dark; and shows her to his friends as proudly as
though the gates of Paradise were opening. He fancies himself alone in
the world and imagines that in his own heart all things begin and
end.... Which is absurd.... But no more of that! Is everything ready?
Put on your hat and turn the sapphire; then they'll come in....</p>

<p>TYLTYL</p>

<p>(<i>Scared</i>.) But I'm not dressed!... Wait, wait!... What shall I put
on?... Oh, what luck!... There are my Sunday clothes on the chair: my
breeches&mdash;they're almost new&mdash;and my clean shirt!... (<i>He dresses
hurriedly</i>.)</p>

<p>THE FAIRY</p>

<p>Come, come, have done! All this doesn't matter; they won't mind your
clothes.... You're not going to meet a lot of silly children. You won't
find them the same as they were in the other life, because this is the
real one; and it's the truth in them that you'll see here.</p>

<p>TYLTYL</p>

<p>(<i>Very uneasy</i>.) Will they all come in together? There are six of them,
at least: I can't remember.... Suppose they started quarrelling and
pulling one another's hair?</p>

<p>THE FAIRY</p>

<p>Just the least bit conceited, aren't you?</p>

<p>TYLTYL</p>

<p>No, but I'm afraid of their making a noise, because of daddy.</p>

<p>THE FAIRY</p>

<p>Haven't I told you again and again, we're no longer in the world
below!... Can't you feel that the air is much purer and the light quite
different?... We are now in a sphere in which men and women don't
quarrel or wish one another harm. All of that was merely make-believe
and doesn't exist deep down.... If some of them are unhappy because you
hesitate in your choice, they will none the less hope on until the end;
and they know very well that where there is love there must also be
sorrow....</p>

<p>TYLTYL</p>

<p>How will they come in?</p>

<p>THE FAIRY</p>

<p>Upon my word, I don't know. Each of them will do what occurs to her: one
will choose the window, another the roof, the wall, the cellar or the
chimney ... one or two even will come in by the door; but those are the
least interesting: they lack imagination.... However, we shall see when
the time comes. We've talked enough; time presses; come, turn the
sapphire....</p>

<p>TYLTYL</p>

<p>(<i>Trying to gain time, in order to conceal his terror</i>.) Which way round
am I to turn it?</p>

<p>THE FAIRY</p>

<p>The same as with the diamond, from right to left.... (<i>Looking at</i>
TYLTYL.) Goodness me, how pale you are!... What has come over you?
Surely you're not afraid?...</p>

<p>TYLTYL</p>

<p>Not at all, on the contrary.... I always look like this....</p>

<p>THE FAIRY</p>

<p>You needn't be ashamed to admit it: this is a very serious moment; and,
if men knew what happened, in this life and all the others, when they
made a bad choice, they'd never dare to get married at all.... But what
you're trying to do is to put off the dreadful moment; and I'm a goose
to be listening to you.... Come, turn the sapphire!</p>

<blockquote><p>(TYLTYL <i>turns the sapphire. No sooner has he done so than the
cottage is filled with a supernatural light, which invests all
things with beauty, purity and a transcendent joy. A window opens
noiselessly and a young girl, dressed like a wood-cutter and
carrying a hatchet in her hand, steps into the room and runs up and
kisses</i> TYLTYL.) </p></blockquote>

<p>THE GIRL</p>

<p>Good evening, Tyltyl!... You called me: here I am!...</p>

<p>TYLTYL</p>

<p>Hullo, it's Milette!... (<i>To</i> THE FAIRY.) This is Milette, my cousin,
the daughter of Feltree, the wood-cutter.... We see each other sometimes
in the forest.... (<i>To</i> MILETTE.) So you loved me?... You never said
so!...</p>

<p>MILETTE</p>

<p>Do people say such things in a life where everything is forbidden? Need
they say them?... But I knew at once and from the first that you loved
me; and so did I love you.... It was one evening when you went past with
your father. You were carrying a bundle of laurel-twigs. You didn't know
my name then and said, "Good evening," and looked into my eyes. I
answered, "Good night," and cast my eyes down; but I had that look of
yours in my heart; and, since then, without leaving home, I've been here
very often; but you didn't seem to know....</p>

<p>TYLTYL</p>

<p>No, no, it's I who every evening after sunset used to go to you. I was
never at home. Mummy would ask, "What are you thinking of, Tyltyl?" And
daddy answered, "He's up in the moon again!" I wasn't in the moon at
all, I was with you; but you paid no attention: you were seeing to the
fire, or the soup, or the rabbits; you were cutting chips or tying up
bundles, as if no one had entered your cottage....</p>

<p>MILETTE</p>

<p>No, I was here and kissing you all the time; but you didn't kiss me....</p>

<p>TYLTYL</p>

<p>I tell you it was I who was always kissing you; I tell you it was you
who were never there....</p>

<p>MILETTE</p>

<p>It's funny that we can never see things till we've learnt how to look
for them.... But, now that we do know, now that we see, we can really
kiss each other....</p>

<p>TYLTYL</p>

<p>(<i>Eagerly kissing</i> MILETTE.) Yes, yes, let's kiss each other again and
again till we have no kisses left!... Oh, how wonderful it is!... I
never kissed anybody till now; and I'd no idea what it was like!... Oh,
how wonderful, how wonderful!... I could kiss you for ever! I could
spend my life kissing you!...</p>

<p>MILETTE</p>

<p>And I, I too!... I'd never kissed anybody either: I mean, I'd only
kissed daddy and mummy; it's not the same thing at all.... But tell me,
Tyltyl, is it true that you love me and only me?... Who is that coming
in?</p>

<blockquote><p>(<i>Opening the wall, which closes again behind her, enter a second
young girl, dressed in a blood-red skirt and bodice. A butcher's
knife hangs from her belt</i>.) </p></blockquote>

<p>THE SECOND GIRL</p>

<p>(<i>Rushing up to</i> TYLTYL <i>and kissing him</i>.) Here I am, Tyltyl darling,
here I am!</p>

<p>TYLTYL</p>

<p>(<i>To</i> THE FAIRY.) This is Belline, my cousin, the butcher's daughter....
(<i>To</i> BELLINE.) What's the matter with you, Belline dear? You're wet
through and quite out of breath!...</p>

<p>BELLINE</p>

<p>I should think I was!... It's a long way from the village to your
place!... I didn't even wait to wash my hands.... I was helping daddy to
cut up a calf; the moment your thoughts came, I dropped my knife and
left everything so as to get here quicker.... I even believe that, while
I was there, I cut my finger rather badly; but here it doesn't show....
Daddy hasn't the least idea what has happened; he must be furious.
(<i>Catching sight of</i> MILETTE.) How do you do, Milette?</p>

<p>MILETTE</p>

<p>How do you do, Belline?... Do you love him too?</p>

<p>BELLINE</p>

<p>Why, yes, of course!... You're not angry with me?</p>

<p>MILETTE</p>

<p>Not at all, I'm glad.... We'll both of us love him....</p>

<p>BELLINE</p>

<p>How pretty you look this evening, Milette dearest....</p>

<p>MILETTE</p>

<p>No, it's you, Belline: you've never been more beautiful....</p>

<p>TYLTYL</p>

<p>(<i>To</i> THE FAIRY.) They're taking it very well!...</p>

<p>THE FAIRY</p>

<p>Of course they are; they know it's not your fault....</p>

<blockquote><p>(<i>At this point, the chimney-recess lights up, opens at the hack
and admits a third young girl, dressed like the maid at an inn and
carrying a pewter tray under one arm and a bottle under the
other</i>.) </p></blockquote>

<p>THE THIRD GIRL</p>

<p>(<i>Enthusiastically, darting at</i> TYLTYL.) Here I am, here I am! It's
me!... Good evening, everybody; but first a kiss for Tyltyl!...</p>

<p>TYLTYL</p>

<p>Hullo, you too, Roselle?... (<i>To</i> THE FAIRY.) This is Roselle, the daughter of the landlord of the
Golden Sun.... (<i>To</i> ROSELLE.) Was there no one at the inn this evening,
that you were able to come?</p>

<p>ROSELLE</p>

<p>On the contrary, heaps of people! You can imagine, on Christmas Eve!
There were men sitting and drinking on the counter and on all the
window-sills. I dropped a tray with twelve glasses on it when you called
me. Why, I've still got the tray under this arm and a bottle of the best
brandy under the other. It gets in my way when I'm kissing you.... I
left them shouting after me, down there, as though I had set the house
on fire.... They must be wondering if I'm mad. But I don't care, I was
so delighted that you were thinking of me. A sudden happiness came over
me.... How are you, Tyltyl dear?... Kiss me again!... You're even
handsomer than when I saw you last....</p>

<p>TYLTYL</p>

<p>(<i>Kissing her</i>.) And you, dear Roselle, you are prettier than ever; and
your cheeks are so soft and cool.... I never dared kiss you before....
When any one else did, I always said to myself, "How happy he must be!"</p>

<p>ROSELLE</p>

<p>The others didn't matter.... But I knew well enough that you didn't
dare.... I didn't dare either, though I was dying to kiss you.... Do you
remember the first time you came to the inn, six weeks ago? It was on a
Sunday morning, after High Mass; you didn't look at anybody; but
suddenly, when I came near, your eyes grew so bright and opened so
wide....</p>

<p>TYLTYL</p>

<p>And so did yours open wide: they looked like two lakes.</p>

<p>ROSELLE</p>

<p>What were they doing, our eyes? What happened?... I know that, since
that day, I think of nothing but you, I do no work, I'm always here; but
you came very seldom....</p>

<blockquote><p>(<i>Coming down the ladder from the attic, enter a fourth young girl,
in rustic clothes, all white with flour</i>.) </p></blockquote>

<p>TYLTYL</p>

<p>(<i>Turning round</i>.) Who's there? You, Aimette?... (<i>To</i> THE FAIRY.) This
is Aimette, another cousin, the miller's daughter....</p>

<p>THE FAIRY</p>

<p>Go on, go on, you're doing very nicely!</p>

<p>AIMETTE</p>

<p>(<i>A little shyly</i>.) I came as I was, from the mill. I've not had time to
brush myself.</p>

<p>TYLTYL</p>

<p>That doesn't matter. Kiss me all the same. How fresh and rosy you are,
underneath all that flour!...</p>

<p>AIMETTE</p>

<p>I shall never dare.... You'd be covered with it....</p>

<blockquote><p>(<i>She has hardly finished speaking when, through the other window,
enter a fifth young girl, bare-foot, bare-headed, clad in rags and
carrying in her hand a wooden bowl with a few halfpence clinking in
it. She does not dare come forward</i>.) </p></blockquote>

<p>TYLTYL</p>

<p>One more!... (<i>To</i> THE FAIRY.) This is Jalline, the little beggar-girl
from the bridge by the Hermitage.</p>

<p>THE FAIRY</p>

<p>Excellent, excellent!... I'd better wake your father and tell him the
house won't be big enough; then he can start building at once....</p>

<p>TYLTYL</p>

<p>But it's not my fault. I didn't do it on purpose. One can't help loving
them!... How are you, Jalline?... What have you done with your poor old
father?</p>

<p>JALLINE</p>

<p>I left him at the bridge.</p>

<p>TYLTYL</p>

<p>What, all alone in the dark! And he blind and a cripple! Isn't that very
dangerous?...</p>

<p>JALLINE (<i>On the verge of tears</i>.) Yes, I know it's wrong. It was very
wrong of me, very. I won't do it again. But I couldn't help it, Tyltyl,
really. When you called me, I couldn't stay where I was.</p>

<p>TYLTYL</p>

<p>(<i>Kissing her</i>.) There, there, don't cry. I'll help you to bring him
home.... Do you remember, I did that once before, one evening when I was
crossing the bridge and gave you a halfpenny: it was all I had!</p>

<p>JALLINE</p>

<p>I've kept it ever since, Tyltyl. I put it in a box. I shall never lose
it.</p>

<p>TYLTYL (<i>Kissing her again</i>.) Oh, the sweet smell of lavender and
thyme!...</p>

<blockquote><p>(<i>This time the door opens slowly. Enter a sixth young girl. She is
in evening-dress, with a fur cloak over her shoulders, and carries
a fan in her hand</i>.) </p></blockquote>

<p>TYLTYL</p>

<p>Who is this?</p>

<p>THE FAIRY</p>

<p>But where do they all come from? At your age too! I should never have
believed it!...</p>

<p>TYLTYL</p>

<p>But I didn't know.... (<i>To</i> THE FAIRY.) Why, it's Rosarelle!... The
mayor's daughter!... You know, from the great big farm-house, with the
three round turrets, at the other end of the village!... What shall I
do? She's so proud!...</p>

<p>THE FAIRY</p>

<p>Not a bit; she won't be any prouder than the others. Speak to her and
you'll see.</p>

<p>TYLTYL</p>

<p>I'll never dare.... What could I say?</p>

<p>ROSARELLE</p>

<p>(<i>Coming forward</i>.) Well, Tyltyl, don't you know me?</p>

<p>TYLTYL</p>

<p>Yes, miss, but I wasn't sure....</p>

<p>ROSARELLE</p>

<p>Miss? What do you mean? That's not my name. My name's Rosarelle; and you
know it.... There was a big dinner at my father's, for Christmas. Your
thoughts came to fetch me while we were at dessert. I jumped up at once
and upset a glass of champagne. They were alarmed and thought I was ill
and began to fuss: it was as much as I could do to get away. Still, here
I am and I'm going to kiss you.... Do you remember how we used to look
at each other when you came to the yard with your bundles of wood?...</p>

<p>TYLTYL</p>

<p>Oh, yes! You were so lovely, I couldn't take my eyes off you.... But you
are lovelier than ever to-day.</p>

<p>ROSARELLE</p>

<p>That was the beginning; but I didn't quite realize it till the day you
gave me the three little bullfinches which you found in the forest.</p>

<p>TYLTYL</p>

<p>Yes, yes, I remember.... I knew too.... Are they still alive?</p>

<p>ROSARELLE</p>

<p>Two of the little things are dead; but the third is splendid.... I keep
him in a gilt cage, by the window; and each time he sings....</p>

<p>THE FAIRY</p>

<p>Come, come, these little confidences are most interesting, but we've no
time to lose. Everything must be settled to-night, for an opportunity
like this comes only once to a man; and woe to him who lets it slip: he
will never have another chance! But what we have to do now is to put our
heads together and prepare for the great choice, which is to decide the
happiness of two human beings first and of many others after that.</p>

<p>TYLTYL</p>

<p>(<i>Greatly perturbed</i>.) Must I make my choice at once and can I only
choose one?...</p>

<p>THE FAIRY</p>

<p>Don't distress yourself; it's not your affair; it's not you who'll
choose....</p>

<p>TYLTYL</p>

<p>(<i>Utterly bewildered</i>.) Not I who'll choose?...</p>

<p>THE FAIRY</p>

<p>Why, no, it doesn't concern you.</p>

<p>TYLTYL</p>

<p>(<i>Completely stupefied</i>.) It doesn't concern me?...</p>

<p>THE FAIRY</p>

<p>No, no, I told you so: of course it doesn't.</p>

<p>TYLTYL</p>

<p>(<i>Failing to understand a word</i>.) Then I can't love whom I want to?</p>

<p>THE FAIRY</p>

<p>Why, no.... Nobody loves whom he wants to or does what he wants to in
this world. You must first of all learn what is wanted by those on whom
you depend.</p>

<p>TYLTYL</p>

<p>By those on whom I depend?...</p>

<p>THE FAIRY</p>

<p>Why, yes: your ancestors, to begin with.</p>

<p>TYLTYL</p>

<p>My ancestors?</p>

<p>THE FAIRY</p>

<p>All those who have died before you.</p>

<p>TYLTYL</p>

<p>What business is it of theirs, since they're dead? I don't know them.</p>

<p>THE FAIRY</p>

<p>I dare say not, but they know you.... And then there are all your
children.</p>

<p>TYLTYL</p>

<p>My children? What children? I've never had any!</p>

<p>THE FAIRY</p>

<p>Yes, yes, yes, you've had thousands who aren't born yet and who're
waiting for the mother whom you're going to give them.</p>

<p>TYLTYL</p>

<p>Then it's they who will choose my bride?</p>

<p>THE FAIRY</p>

<p>Why, of course; that's how things always happen.... But let's have no
more talk: we have to make a few preparations for the great journey;
it's going to be rather long and tiring.... And first we must get some
money: I've none left at home; and my magic wand that brings it me is
being repaired a few thousand miles down in the centre of the earth ...
don't quite see where we're to get what we want: the expenses will be
quite heavy.... (<i>To</i> THE GIRLS.) Has any one of you a few thousand
francs on her?</p>

<p>JALLINE</p>

<p>I've only sixpence halfpenny in my bowl, besides Tyltyl's halfpenny,
which I can't part with.</p>

<p>ROSELLE</p>

<p>I've seven francs fifty, to-night's takings.</p>

<p>MILETTE</p>

<p>I've nothing at all.</p>

<p>ROSARELLE</p>

<p>I've nothing on me, but grandfather's very rich.</p>

<p>THE FAIRY</p>

<p>That's all right, it's all we need: he can lend us some money.</p>

<p>ROSARELLE</p>

<p>Yes, but he's a miser!</p>

<p>THE FAIRY</p>

<p>No, that's a mistake; there are no misers. Thanks to the sapphire which
reveals the heart and essence of things, you will see that he is no more
of a miser than you or I and that he will give us whatever we ask.
That's the first visit we shall have to pay.... Well, are you all ready?
Which way shall we go out?</p>

<blockquote><p>(<i>At this point, a trap-door opens, in the middle of the stage, and
from it there rises slowly, like a tower, a gigantic shape, twice a
man's height. It is square, enormous, imposing and overwhelming; it

inflexible force. Its face is not seen. It is draped in grey folds

<p>THE SHAPE</p>

<p>It's I. You have forgotten me, as usual!...</p>

<p>TYLTYL</p>

<p>(<i>Not a little frightened</i>.) Who is this gentleman?</p>

<p>THE FAIRY</p>

<p>He's right, I had forgotten him. It's nobody, it's Destiny. I didn't
foresee that the sapphire would make him visible also. He will have to
come with us; we can't prevent him; he's entitled to. Give him your
hand.</p>

<p>TYLTYL</p>

<p>Will he lead us?</p>

<p>THE FAIRY</p>

<p>That remains to be seen. We must hear what Light says: it's a matter for
her.</p>

<p>TYLTYL</p>

<p>Why, of course. Light!... Where is she?... Isn't she going with us?</p>

<p>THE FAIRY</p>

<p>Yes, yes, but she has a great deal to do at the moment.... She wasn't
free this evening.... We shall find her at my place, where we shall go
straight from your visit to the miser.</p>

<p>TYLTYL</p>

<p>How glad I shall be to see her again!... She was so nice, so sweet, so
beautiful, so affectionate and kind!...</p>

<p>THE FAIRY</p>

<p>Come, give Destiny your hand; it's time to start.</p>

steel vice!...</p>

<p>THE FAIRY</p>

<p>It's nothing, you'll get used to it.... Come, is everything ready at
last? Nothing more that we've forgotten? Then one, two, three and off we
go!...</p>

<p>TYLTYL</p>

<p>Who's there?... Come in, can't you?...</p>

<p>TYLTYL</p>

<p>What is it?</p>

<p>THE FAIRY</p>

<p>Really, I don't know.... It must be one of those whom you've
forgotten....</p>

<p>TYLTYL</p>

<p>(<i>Vainly ransacking his memory</i>.) I?... I've forgotten nobody.... I've
never seen her before.... I can't remember.... (<i>Going up to</i> THE VEILED
FORM.) Who are you? (THE VEILED FORM <i>does not reply</i>.)</p>

<p>THE FAIRY</p>

<p>It's no use asking her. She can't tell you, she can't come to life till
you remember her.</p>

<p>TYLTYL</p>

<p>But I don't. I'm thinking and trying as hard as I can, but I can find
nothing.</p>

<p>THE FAIRY</p>

<p>Very well, very well, we shall see later, when everything is cleared
up.... As she blocks the path, we must go out by the window.... Come,
this way! We have taken our fate in our hands; and things have begun!...</p>

<p>DESTINY</p>

<h3>ACT II</h3>



<h3><a name="SCENE_II" id="SCENE_II"></a>SCENE II</h3>


<blockquote><p><i>Outside the Door</i></p>

<p><i>The curtain represents a huge double door surmounted with a
flattened arch. The door is old, thick and massive, unyielding,
bound and studded with iron bars and nails. In the middle of the
door is a formidable lock</i>.</p>

<p>(<i>Enter</i> THE FAIRY <i>and</i> TYLTYL, <i>who carries an empty wallet over
his shoulder</i>.) </p></blockquote>

<p>THE FAIRY</p>

<p>This is the Miser's door.</p>

<p>TYLTYL</p>

<p>Where are my sweethearts?</p>

<p>THE FAIRY</p>

<p>At home, in my palace; they'll wait there for you and will be quite
safe.... Be quick and come back soon.</p>

<p>TYLTYL</p>

<p>What about Destiny? I thought he would never leave me again?</p>

<p>THE FAIRY</p>

<p>That's true; it's curious. But it's not our business to run after him;
it's his own affair; he's by no means indispensable.</p>

<p>TYLTYL</p>

<p>Are you coming with me to the Miser?</p>

<p>THE FAIRY</p>

<p>No, it's better that you should see him alone.... You're not frightened,
are you?</p>

<p>TYLTYL</p>

<p>Not a bit; but I don't quite know what I am to do.</p>

<p>THE FAIRY</p>

<p>It's very simple: when you're in there, you turn the sapphire; and he'll
give you anything you want.</p>

<p>TYLTYL</p>

<p>He won't attack me? I've no weapons, you know.</p>

<p>THE FAIRY</p>

<p>On the contrary, he will be delighted to be of service.</p>

<p>TYLTYL</p>

<p>How shall I get in? There's no bell and no knocker. Am I to tap at the
door?</p>

<p>THE FAIRY</p>

<p>Do nothing of the sort! That would be giving him a hint; and he would
become unmanageable.... But this also is quite simple. I will touch the
big lock with my wand; the doors will slide back to right and left; and
you will suddenly be on the other side, that is to say, right inside the
cave, before he even suspects it. Once there, you can keep quiet in your
corner for a moment and watch him playing with his gold, if that amuses
you; and it will amuse you, for it's rather curious. Then, when you've
had enough, turn the sapphire. Get over there, on the left, against the
wall of the arch, so that you can slip into his den at once, without
making a noise.... Look out! The door will disappear! And I'll take
myself off this way!... (<i>She touches the great lock with her wand</i>.)</p>

<h3><a name="SCENE_III" id="SCENE_III"></a>SCENE III</h3>


<blockquote><p><i>The Miser's Cave</i></p>

<p>(<i>The heavy doors open in the middle, slide right and left and
disappear in the slips, revealing the whole of</i> THE MISER'S <i>den,
an immense cave with low arches in which are piled large sacks
bursting with gold, silver and copper coins. The only light comes
from a wretched smoking candle</i>. TYLTYL <i>hides himself as well as
he can in a dark corner</i>. THE MISER, <i>an old, hook-nosed man, with
a dirty white beard and long, scanty hair, is dressed in a sort of
squalid, patched dressing-gown. On the floor is an old carpet, with
three sacks bulging with gold at one corner</i>.) </p></blockquote>

<p>THE MISER</p>

<p>To-day I shall count the contents of these three sacks all over again. I
must have made a mistake in my last reckoning. There are three louis
missing. Three louis are sixty francs, which make a considerable
difference in a total of six hundred thousand francs. It's quite
impossible to sleep with that anxiety on one's mind. Each of these three
sacks ought to hold two hundred thousand francs, the first and second in
louis of twenty francs and the third in ten-franc pieces. I shall empty
them on the carpet first to see what a lovely heap they make.... (<i>He
empties the contents of the first sack on the carpet</i>.) How they
sparkle, how they sparkle!... What a lot of them there are!... When you
see the gold spreading itself out, it's impossible to believe that it
all could go into one sack!... Let's have another.... This is the sack
with the little ten-franc pieces.... (<i>He empties a second sack</i>.) They
are as lovely as the big ones.... They are younger, that's all, and
there are more of them.... Now let's see what the third holds.... (<i>He
empties the third sack. A few gold coins roll of the carpet. He throws
himself flat on the floor to catch them</i>.) Oh, no, oh, no, children!...
This won't do!... You mustn't run away like that!... Nothing is allowed
to leave this cave!... Trying to hide yourselves, are you? To go where,
pray? Don't you know that there's no place like home?... Fancy running
away like that from daddy! I should never have thought it of you! This
way, children, this way, darlings. This way, my pretty ones! Back to the
heap, back to the cradle, then you'll be happy!... (<i>He picks up a coin
which has rolled farther than the rest</i>.) Don't do it again, you: you're
always making off; you're a little torment and you set a bad example.
Beg my pardon, or I'll punish you. You shall be the first to be spent;
I'll give you to a beggar, do you hear?... (<i>Kissing it</i>.) No, no, I'm
only pretending.... There, there, don't cry!... I was merely frightening
you.... I love you all the same, but don't do it again!... Here, here,
here, they're here, in front of me and all around me.... It will take me
quite a fortnight to count them all and to weigh them in my scales....
What a lot of them, what a lot of them! And how pretty they are!... I
know them every one, I could call them by their names.... They would
need a hundred and twenty thousand different names; and each of those
names stands for a treasure!... (<i>He rolls on the carpet amidst the
gold</i>.) I love to see them close!... Oh, what a cosy bed! And what a joy
it is to be among one's daughters!... For they are my daughters: I
brought them into the world; I have nurtured them, protected them from
harm, fondled and pampered them; I know their history, the trouble
they've given me, but all is forgotten: they love me, I love them and we
shall never part again!... Oh, what a fine thing happiness is!... (<i>He
fills his two hands with the gold, makes it trickle over his heart, on
his forehead and in his heard and utters little sighs of pleasure which
gradually swell into roars of delight. Suddenly, he shudders, starts and
springs up, thinking that he has heard a sound</i>.) What is it?... Who's
there?... (<i>Reassuring himself</i>.) No, no, it's nothing ... no one would
dare.... (<i>He sees</i> TYLTYL <i>and gives a shout</i>.) A thief!... A thief!...
A thief!... You here!... You here!... (<i>With his hands clutching like
claws, terrified and terrifying, he rushes upon</i> TYLTYL, <i>who jumps back
and quickly turns the sapphire</i>. THE MISER <i>stops short. After an inward
struggle which seems violent and lasts for some seconds, his hands drop
to his sides, his face brightens and loses its hardness. He seems to
wake from a bad dream and tries to wipe the memory of it from his
forehead. He gazes with astonishment at the gold spread over the carpet,
feels and pushes it with his foot, seems not to know what it is and then
addresses</i> TYLTYL <i>in a very calm and gentle voice</i>.)</p>

<p>THE MISER</p>

<p>You must have awakened me.... How did you get here?... What have you
come for?...</p>

<p>TYLTYL</p>

<p>I've come to ask you to lend me a little money.... I understand that I
want some in order to discover my bride....</p>

<p>THE MISER</p>

<p>Have you anything to put it in?</p>

<p>TYLTYL</p>

<p>I've brought this wallet.</p>

<p>THE MISER</p>

<p>I shall be delighted to fill it for you; but I warn you that gold is
very heavy and that you won't be able to carry it away.</p>

<p>TYLTYL</p>

<p>You must put in just what you think fit.</p>

<p>THE MISER</p>

<p>(<i>Pouring the gold by handfuls into the wallet</i>.) Help me, will you?...
We'll fill it to the brim and see how that does.... We can easily
lighten it afterwards, if it's too heavy....</p>

<p>TYLTYL</p>

<p>Oh, you're giving me too much, I don't want all that!... So you're not a
miser, as they told me?</p>

<p>THE MISER</p>

<p>I? Not at all. Why should I be?... I have only a few weeks to live and
am not in need of anything.... I hardly eat at all; and I drink nothing
but water.</p>

<p>TYLTYL</p>

<p>Why were you lying on your gold when I came in, kissing it and calling
it by pet names? You seemed to worship it.</p>

<p>THE MISER</p>

<p>Oh, I don't know! It amuses me. When a man grows old, he has to amuse
himself as best he can.... But it isn't I who do it. All that is only a
sort of dream. I am thinking of something very different.... All men are
like that at my age. They are not often where you see them; they are not
often doing what they appear to do; and every one lives in one of those
dreams which have nothing to do with the truth.... But this is not the
moment to explain things to you.... There, your wallet it full. Can you
lift it?</p>

<p>TYLTYL</p>

<p>(<i>Making an effort</i>.) No, really, it is a bit too heavy.... Let's take
some of it out....</p>

<p>THE MISER</p>

<p>(<i>Emptying part of the wallet</i>.) I daresay that's better.</p>

<p>TYLTYL</p>

<p>Oh, look here, you're taking it all!... There won't be enough left.... I
must put a little of it back....</p>

<p>THE MISER</p>

<p>I say, are you becoming a miser now?</p>

<p>TYLTYL</p>

<p>No, but I don't know that I shall have a chance of coming back again....
Just help me lift the wallet on my shoulder....</p>

<p>THE MISER</p>

<p>(<i>Helping him with the wallet</i>.) There you are!</p>

<p>TYLTYL</p>

<p>(<i>Staggering under the load</i>.) I say, what a weight gold is!</p>

<p>THE MISER</p>

<p>Don't I know it?... Have you far to go?</p>

<p>TYLTYL</p>

<p>I really can't tell.</p>

<p>THE MISER</p>

<p>What's the weather like outside?</p>

<p>TYLTYL</p>

<p>It was bright sunshine.</p>

<p>THE MISER</p>

<p>One wouldn't think it in here.... Fancy, it's years since I've looked at
the sky or the green trees!... But you can't breathe under the weight of
your bag, you poor little man!... Come, kiss me good-bye: there's no
knowing when we shall meet again.... Thanks for the pleasant time you
have given me and especially for waking me up.... I shall make the most
of my remaining days....</p>

<p>TYLTYL</p>

<p>Which is the way out?</p>

<p>THE MISER</p>

<p>That way, I suppose.</p>

accessories of the Tales of Mother Goose: Cinderella's pumpkin and
glass slipper; Red Ridinghood's cake and bowl; Hop-o'-my-Thumb's
pebbles; the Ogre's daughters' golden crowns; the Sleeping Beauty's
distaff and snake-tub; the Giant's seven-leagued hoots; Blue
Beard's key; the Blue Bird in his silver cage; and, hanging from
the wall, Catskin's weather-coloured, moon-coloured and
sun-coloured dresses. All these things look rather tawdry in the
grey and unbecoming light</i>. TYLTYL'S <i>seven little friends are
locked up in this room. In the same unsympathetic light they look
much less pretty than when they entered the cottage and they seem
rather tired, discontented and glum, except</i> THE VEILED GIRL, <i>who
stands on one side, motionless, impassive and unrevealing</i>. </p></blockquote>

<p>BELLINE</p>

<p>Where have they brought us?</p>

<p>ROSARELLE</p>

<p>I don't know; but I must say that it's not a nice place in which to keep
young ladies waiting.</p>

<p>BELLINE</p>

<p>Yes, it looks like a lumber-room where they've stored all the odds and
ends and litter of the house.</p>

<p>ROSARELLE</p>

<p>(<i>Touching the various objects in disgust</i>.) What's this? A distaff?
Bless me, what for?... A pumpkin, a cake, an old bowl and goodness knows
what else!... A tub full of dead eels! Gracious, how they smell!... It's
all disgracefully kept.... And that lot of old fly-blown, spun-glass
dresses!... My dear, how horrible!... What sort of place can this be? A
potting-shed, a rag-and-bone shop, a pawn-broker's, or a thieves'
kitchen? Whom can it belong to? A receiver of stolen goods? (<i>Touching
the more bizarre dresses</i>.) Or a Hottentot dressmaker?</p>

<p>BELLINE</p>

<p>There's something of everything ... except a broom and a duster.</p>

<p>ROSARELLE</p>

<p>One wouldn't be enough.</p>

<p>BELLINE</p>

<p>And nothing to sit on but an old wooden bench....</p>

<p>ROSARELLE</p>

<p>But it's carved, my love!...</p>

<p>BELLINE</p>

<p>Yes, carved in dust.</p>

<p>ROSARELLE</p>

<p>Reach me one of those hideous rags and let me wipe it....</p>

<p>BELLINE</p>

<p>(<i>Eagerly and obsequiously</i>.) Wait, miss, I'll do that.... (<i>She takes
the moon-coloured dress and dusts the seat with it</i>.) There, that's a
little better; that's at least one corner nearly clean enough to sit on.</p>

<p>ROSARELLE</p>

<p>(<i>Sitting down</i>.) I'm tired out!</p>

<p>BELLINE</p>

<p>(<i>Sitting down beside her</i>.) So am I; my feet are dreadfully sore.</p>

<p>ROSARELLE</p>

<p>(<i>Looking around through her lorgnette</i>.) But what I want to know is
where have we got to? My dear, have we fallen into a trap?</p>

<p>BELLINE</p>

<p>The company certainly is a little mixed. There's the miller's daughter,
the girl from the inn, the wood-cutter....</p>

<p>ROSARELLE</p>

<p>Or rather, to be accurate, the wood-stealer.... There's even the little
beggar-girl from the bridge by the Hermitage, to whom I refused a penny
last Sunday.... My dear, you should have heard the insolent way in which
she asked for it!...</p>

<p>BELLINE</p>

<p>And what's that white image standing in the corner, the one that never
stirs, never speaks and follows us wherever we go?</p>

<p>ROSARELLE</p>

<p>That great lump of clay, that ugly wax-work? That washed-out plaster
saint?</p>

<p>BELLINE</p>

<p>She looks very ill.</p>

<p>ROSARELLE</p>

<p>She may have Jewish leprosy or Zanzibar plague or Bombay cholera.... I
tell you, we must be careful: that's all very catching....</p>

<p>AIMETTE</p>

<p>(<i>Coming up to the bench timidly</i>.) I should like to sit down too, I'm
very tired....</p>

<p>ROSARELLE</p>

<p>Mind what you're about, miss!... There's dust enough as it is; I don't
want flour into the bargain.</p>

<p>ROSELLE</p>

<p>What's all this, what's all this? Are we turning up our nose at flour
now?</p>

<p>ROSARELLE</p>

<p>I wasn't addressing my remarks to you, madam.</p>

<p>ROSELLE</p>

<p>No, but I'm speaking to you. What bread would you eat if you had no
flour?</p>

<p>ROSARELLE</p>

<p>You would do better to tell your father to pay the three quarters' rent
that's in arrear.</p>

<p>ROSELLE</p>

<p>He'll pay his rent when your horrid old miser of a grandfather has seen
to those repairs. We've been asking to have them done these last three
years.</p>

<p>BELLINE</p>

<p>Is it the repairs that prevent your father from paying his butcher's
bills?</p>

<p>ROSELLE</p>

<p>Does he owe anything at your shop?</p>

<p>BELLINE</p>

<p>It's six months since we saw the colour of his money.</p>

<p>ROSELLE</p>

<p>He's waiting to see the colour of yours at the inn.</p>

<p>BELLINE</p>

<p>Of mine indeed? You can wait a long time before I set foot in your dirty
dram-shop.</p>

<p>ROSELLE</p>

<p>Yes, but that father of yours isn't so squeamish when he comes on
Sundays and tipples till we have to put him out dead-drunk.</p>

<p>ROSARELLE</p>

<p>Don't answer her, my dear; we are not accustomed to these pot-house
brawls.</p>

<p>ROSELLE</p>

<p>As for you, miss, who pretend to be so particular, you just go and ask
your father, the mayor, who it was that nibbled the holes, which were
not made by rats, in the town's cash-box.</p>

<p>ROSARELLE</p>

<p>(<i>Springing to her feet, furiously</i>.) Holes which were not made by rats!
What do you mean?</p>

<p>ROSELLE</p>

<p>I mean what every one in the village means!...</p>

<p>ROSARELLE</p>

<p>Mind what you're saying; and say it again if you dare.</p>

<p>ROSELLE</p>

<p>Well, what would you do if I did say it again? You don't frighten me
with your airs and graces.</p>

<p>ROSARELLE</p>

<p>Never mind my airs and graces; I'll soon show you what I'll do.</p>

<p>ROSELLE</p>

<p>Well, then, I do say it again.</p>

<p>ROSARELLE</p>

<p>(<i>Boxing her ears</i>.) And take that for your answer!...</p>

<blockquote><p>(<i>Piercing screams and a general turmoil</i>. ROSELLE and AIMETTE
<i>make a rush at</i> BELLINE <i>and</i> ROSARELLE, <i>while</i> MILETTE <i>and</i>
JALLINE <i>vainly try to separate the combatants</i>. THE VEILED GIRL
<i>alone remains motionless in her corner, as though she were not
present. The others claw one another's faces, tear one another's
hair and end by uttering such piercing yells and shrieks that</i>
TYLTYL, <i>returning from the</i> MISER'S, <i>hears them from the far end
of the palace and comes running up, scared and dismayed. He is
bare-headed and only half-dressed and does not understand what is
going on</i>.) </p></blockquote>

<p>TYLTYL</p>

<p>What is it? What's the matter? What has happened? An accident? Are you
hurt? What have you been doing?</p>

<p>THE GIRLS</p>

<p>(<i>All speaking together</i>.) It's she!... No, no, it was Rosarelle who
began!... I tell you, it was she!... She insulted me!... She boxed my
ears!... She dared to talk against my father!... She spoke ill of my
mother!... She's lying, she's lying!... She nearly pulled my ear off!...
She's driven a hairpin into my cheek!...</p>

<blockquote><p>(<i>Enter</i> THE FAIRY.) </p></blockquote>

<p>THE FAIRY</p>

<p>Why, what's the matter?</p>

<p>TYLTYL</p>

<p>(<i>In bewilderment</i>.) I don't know, ma'am. I think they must have gone
mad. They were so sweet when I left them. I should never have known
them!... Look, look, they are quite different!... Rosarelle and
Belline's eyes are blazing like furies', Aimette looks so spiteful and
Roselle so brazen, Jalline hasn't washed herself and Milette's cheeks
are as red as a turkey-cock's.... (<i>Bursting into tears and hiding his
eyes with his arm, like a child crying</i>.) I can't bear it! Oh, I can't
bear it!</p>

<p>THE FAIRY</p>

<p>But, you little silly, it's your own fault!</p>

<p>TYLTYL</p>

<p>My fault?</p>

<p>THE FAIRY</p>

<p>Yes, of course, it's your fault.... And, first, where have you come
from? What have you done with your jacket and your green hat?</p>

<p>TYLTYL</p>

<p>Why, ma'am, I was busy dressing; I was putting on the little pair of
silk breeches and the jacket embroidered with pearls which you told me I
was to wear when I went to see the Ancestors.... Then I heard screams,
dropped everything, ran up and found them fighting, tearing out one
another's hair and scratching one another's faces....</p>

<p>THE FAIRY</p>

<p>A pretty business!... That will teach you to run after them without your
talisman, which reveals the truth.... I call it most incorrect and
improper.... Don't you see that you are not seeing them now as they
are?...</p>

<p>TYLTYL</p>

<p>I'm not seeing them as they are?... Then how do I see them?...</p>

<p>THE FAIRY</p>

<p>Why, as they are not, that is to say, as you ought never to see them....
It's all so wonderfully simple: anything that's ugly isn't true, never
has been true and never will be.</p>

<p>TYLTYL</p>

<p>That's easily said; but you see what you do see.</p>

<p>THE FAIRY</p>

<p>When you see what you do see, you see nothing at all.... I've told you
before, it's what you do not see that makes the world go round.... All
this doesn't count; it's only a little foam on the surface of the
ocean.... But run quickly and fetch the sapphire and we shall once more
see deep down into their souls, the truth of their hearts and the
well-spring of their life.... Wait, you needn't trouble: I see Light
coming; she has brought you your hat.</p>

<blockquote><p>(<i>Enter</i> LIGHT.) </p></blockquote>

<p>LIGHT</p>

<p>Good-evening, Tyltyl.</p>

<p>TYLTYL</p>

<p>(<i>Throwing himself passionately into her arms</i>.) Oh, Light, Light!...
It's my dear Light!... Where were you?... What have you been doing ever
since I saw you last?... I have missed you so much and looked for you so
often!...</p>

<p>LIGHT</p>

<p>My dear little Tyltyl!... I have never lost sight of you.... I have
guided you and counselled you and kissed you very often, without your
knowing it.... But we will talk about all this later; to-day we have no
time; I have only one night to give you and there is a great deal to be
done.</p>

<blockquote><p>(<i>Enter</i> DESTINY.) </p></blockquote>

<p>DESTINY</p>

<p>Where is Tyltyl?</p>

<p>TYLTYL</p>

<p>Here. I'm not trying to hide.</p>

<p>DESTINY</p>

<p>And quite right too, for it would be no use; there's no escaping me....</p>

<p>TYLTYL</p>

<blockquote><p>(<i>Contemplating him in astonishment</i>.) </p></blockquote>

<p>But what's the matter with you?... What has happened to you? You look so
much smaller!... You seem to be less tall and less broad.... You're not
ill, are you?...</p>

<p>DESTINY</p>

<blockquote><p>(<i>Who has indeed shrunk appreciably</i>.) </p></blockquote>

<p>I? I never change, I am always the same; I am insuperable, insensible,
invulnerable, immutable, inexorable, irresistible, invisible, inflexible
and irrevocable!...</p>

<p>TYLTYL</p>

<p>All right, all right, what I said was merely....</p>

<p>THE FAIRY</p>

<p>(<i>Aside, to</i> TYLTYL.) Be quiet, you will only vex him and he will get
out of hand.... It is probably being so close to Light that has upset
him; they never did agree.... (<i>Aloud</i>.) Come, children, it's time....
Put on your hat, Tyltyl, and turn the sapphire; we shall see what
happens: sometimes it works upon people's hearts, sometimes on their
minds, sometimes on the objects around them and often on all three; one
cannot tell before-hand....</p>

<blockquote><p>(<i>He turns the sapphire. The closet brightens with a blue and
supernatural light which gives beauty and life to everything in the
room; the accessories of Mother Goose seem to wake up: the spindle
revolves madly and unreels threads of gold and crystal; the pumpkin
swells, sways from side to side and lights up; the Blue Bird bursts
into song; the snake-tub bubbles and pours forth fruits and
flowers; the moon-coloured and sun-coloured dresses wave and
glitter; the columns and aisles gleam with precious stones. But the
group of</i> GIRLS <i>especially undergoes a radical and wonderful
transformation: their features relax, their eyes open wider, smiles
blossom on their lips, their frocks become gay and splendid,
innocence, gladness, kindness and beauty bloom once more; and</i>
TYLTYL, <i>in an ecstasy, clapping his hands, intoxicated with
delight, rushes into the midst of them, giving and receiving kisses
and not knowing which of them to listen to</i>.) </p></blockquote>

<p>TYLTYL</p>

<p>They're themselves again, they're themselves again!... How lovely they
are, how lovely they are!... Jalline, Milette my darling, Aimette,
Belline darling, Rosarelle, Roselle!... They are all as they were before
and I love every one of them!... Let us kiss again, again, again!... Oh,
let us kiss for ever!...</p>

<blockquote><p>(<i>At this moment</i>, THE VEILED GIRL, <i>who has played no part in the
transfiguration or in the general ecstasy, staggers in her corner
and, without uttering a sound, falls suddenly and unresistingly,
like a statue, and lies motionless, stretched on the floor.
Silence, terror and consternation, followed by cries and bustle</i>;
THE GIRLS <i>rush to her assistance and gather eagerly round her</i>.) </p></blockquote>

<p>ROSELLE</p>

<p>(<i>Lifting her up</i>.) Help me, somebody!</p>

<p>ROSARELLE</p>

<p>She isn't hurt, is she?</p>

<p>ROSELLE</p>

<p>(<i>Examining her anxiously</i>.) No, no, I can't see anything.</p>

<p>AIMETTE</p>

<p>(<i>Stroking her forehead</i>.) She's breathing, she's sighing.</p>

<p>ROSARELLE</p>

<p>(<i>Kissing her</i>.) She has only fainted.... Tell us what you feel....
You're not in pain, dear, are you?</p>

<p>MILETTE</p>

<p>She doesn't answer.</p>

<p>JALLINE</p>

<p>(<i>Taking one of her hands and stroking it</i>.) Perhaps she's hungry.</p>

<p>MILETTE</p>

<p>(<i>Stroking the other hand</i>.) No, can't you feel? She's cold.</p>

<p>JALLINE</p>

<p>Will you have my cloak?</p>

<p>ROSELLE</p>

<p>No, no, it's not that.... What she wants is a drop of brandy.... I
haven't my bottle.... And don't all crowd round her, she's suffocating.
She wants air!...</p>

<p>ROSARELLE</p>

<p>(<i>Supporting her head</i>.) Have you some water there?... We ought to send
for a doctor....</p>

<p>BELLINE</p>

<p>She's as white as marble.... She might be dead....</p>

<p>ROSARELLE</p>

<p>No, no, she's coming to.... I can hear her heart beating....</p>

<p>THE FAIRY</p>

<p>(<i>Intervening</i>.) Come, come, it's nothing.... I have practised medicine
longer than men have and know a little more about it. Do not be uneasy;
there is nothing to fear; I will undertake to cure her.... But we are
wasting precious time, the night is passing and we shall get nothing
done.... (<i>To</i> THE GIRLS.) Come, dears, go and dress yourselves; your
cloaks are waiting for you and everything is ready. Just follow Light;
she will advise you.... We will meet in the great ballroom of the
palace.... (THE GIRLS <i>go out, preceded by</i> LIGHT. <i>To</i> DESTINY.) You
too, Destiny, follow Light; you want another costume. You can't go as
you are. One must not be conspicuous, especially at this moment....
(DESTINY <i>obeys, grudgingly</i>.) I don't quite know how to dress the
fellow. However, Light will think of something: she has more imagination
than I.... Let's see to the little patient. She's better.... (<i>Helping
her to rise</i>.) There, there.... Sit down on this bench.... No?... You
prefer to stand up?... As you please: in that case, lean against the
column, for the walls will soon disappear.... Now that we are alone,
Tyltyl, will you tell me at last, between ourselves, who that girl
is?...</p>

<p>TYLTYL</p>

<p>But, ma'am, I don't know at all....</p>

<p>THE FAIRY</p>

<p>You must make an effort.... She can't live unless you remember who she
is.... It's a great responsibility.</p>

<p>TYLTYL</p>

<p>But it's not my fault.... I've done what I could; I can't make it out.</p>

<p>THE FAIRY</p>

<p>So much the worse for you. I can't understand it either.... Come, get
dressed. Here's the little jacket which Light brought you.... And now,
with one stroke of the wand, we will enter the ballroom and see what
your little friends have made of themselves. (<i>She touches the panels of
the closet, which disappear</i>.)</p>

<h3>ACT III</h3>



<h3><a name="SCENE_VI" id="SCENE_VI"></a>SCENE VI</h3>

<blockquote><p><i>Before the Curtain representing Rocks</i></p>

<p>(<i>Enter</i> TYLTYL <i>and</i> LIGHT.) </p></blockquote>

<p>TYLTYL</p>

<p>(<i>Out of breath, dropping on to a boulder</i>.) They live a long way up,
the Ancestors!... Aren't you tired?</p>

<p>LIGHT</p>

<p>No, I was born in the mountains.</p>

<p>TYLTYL</p>

<p>(<i>Bending over a crevice</i>.) You're not like Destiny, who has almost
given out.... He's still at the bottom of the last precipice, with my
little friends.... He stumbles at every step and is limping badly....
They won't be here yet awhile; and I am very glad to have a moment alone
with you, before they come, for I have a lot of things to ask you....</p>

<p>LIGHT</p>

<p>Ask me anything you like, dear; I will do my best to answer.</p>

<p>TYLTYL</p>

<p>What do you think of these little friends of mine?... If you had to
choose, which would you take?...</p>

<p>LIGHT</p>

<p>I like them all, but it is not for me to choose; no one but yourself can
tell which one you love best.</p>

<p>TYLTYL</p>

<p>Ah, that's not so easy!... You see, I love them all!... For instance, I
love little Jalline, the beggar's daughter: she is so gentle and sweet,
such a darling!...</p>

<p>LIGHT</p>

<p>Yes, she is very attractive: a pretty little creature, with a pure and
simple mind....</p>

<p>TYLTYL</p>

<p>But I also love the Mayor's daughter, Rosarelle.... She is really very
beautiful, not a bit conceited and much better-educated than the
others.... And then think of what she has done: she has left everything
to go with me....</p>

<p>LIGHT</p>

<p>Yes, that is the proof of a real love....</p>

<p>TYLTYL</p>

<p>But I also love Roselle, the inn-keeper's daughter, who is a very pretty
girl, so healthy and strong and frank and brave and cheerful and
amusing: you can't think how kind and affectionate she is....</p>

<p>LIGHT</p>

<p>Yes, she has qualities; and I too find her very sympathetic....</p>

<p>TYLTYL</p>

<p>But I also love the wood-cutter's daughter, Milette.... She has such
beautiful eyes and hair!... At first she seems a little awkward, a
little shy; but it's quite different when you know her: she is really
very playful and full of fun.... And then, have you noticed her mouth
and her teeth?</p>

<p>LIGHT</p>

<p>Yes, I've noticed them....</p>

<p>TYLTYL</p>

<p>But I also love Belline, the butcher's daughter.... To begin with, she's
my cousin; and one always loves one's cousins. And then there's
something about her dark beautiful eyes that frightens me rather. I
adore that.... But she's not unkind, not at all.... Have you noticed her
smile? One can never tell exactly what it means....</p>

<p>LIGHT</p>

<p>Yes, she has a strange smile....</p>

<p>TYLTYL</p>

<p>But I also love the miller's daughter, Aimette.... To begin with, she's
also my cousin.... She keeps her eyes lowered under her long, curling
eyelashes; she blushes when you look at her and weeps when you speak to
her.... She looks a little silly; well, she's not that at all. She's
quite different when you know her a bit.... She's very bright and very
jolly and whispers such nice, sweet things to you that you at once want
to kiss her....</p>

<p>LIGHT</p>

<p>I can see that the choice will not be easy.</p>

<p>TYLTYL</p>

<p>Which do you think the best?</p>

<p>LIGHT</p>

<p>There are neither better nor worse; each one is as good as the other;
and all are good when they suffer or when they love.</p>

<p>TYLTYL</p>

<p>The nuisance is that it seems you mustn't love more than one.... Tell
me, though, is that true, or is it only one of the things people say to
children just to keep them quiet?</p>

<p>LIGHT</p>

<p>No, it's true. When you love many, that merely shows that you haven't
yet found the one whom you were to love.</p>

<p>TYLTYL</p>

<p>But, after all, you, who know everything and see everything, must know
better than I and can tell me what I ought to do.</p>

<p>LIGHT</p>

<p>No, dear, that is beyond me, beyond the range of my sight. It is for
this very reason that we are going to consult those who do know; and
they are near at hand, because it is in you that they live. We seem to
be taking a great journey: that is an illusion; we are not going outside
yourself and all our adventures are happening within you.... But I hear
your little friends. Where is your green hat?</p>

<p>TYLTYL</p>

<p>Here. I took it off because I felt hot.</p>

<p>LIGHT</p>

<p>Put it on again quickly, so that there may be no more misunderstandings,
and turn the sapphire.</p>

<blockquote><p>(<i>He does so. Forthwith, on every side, all sorts of monsters
emerge from the ground and from between the rocks: monsters with
more or less human or animal shapes and grotesque, brutish or
repulsive faces. They hustle</i> TYLTYL, <i>gather together and dance
round him</i>.) </p></blockquote>

<p>TYLTYL</p>

<p>(<i>Terrified</i>.) Hullo, hullo, what's all this?...</p>

<p>LIGHT</p>

<p>Nothing. You must have turned the sapphire from left to right.</p>

<p>TYLTYL</p>

<p>So I did, I believe; I forgot.... But what do they want with me? They
are pushing up against me and snapping at my feet.</p>

<p>LIGHT</p>

<p>They won't hurt you; they are merely your own thoughts, which you
sometimes secretly think; now you have set them free and they are
showing themselves for an instant as they are.</p>

<p>TYLTYL</p>

<p>What!... Are my thoughts as ugly as that?... I should never have
believed it!...</p>

<p>LIGHT</p>

<p>Don't take it so much to heart!... They are not as ugly as some, because
you are still innocent and very young.... If you were to see those of
other men!... Besides, you have beautiful ones; but they are more
reluctant to show themselves.... However, I see the girls coming....
Turn the sapphire from right to left, so that we may get rid of these
monsters, whom they must not see....</p>

<blockquote><p>(<i>He does so; and the creatures go back into the ground. Enter</i> THE
SIX GIRLS, <i>preceded by</i> DESTINY <i>and followed, at a distance, by</i>
THE WHITE PHANTOM, <i>who keeps on one side. They surround</i> TYLTYL,
<i>overwhelming him with caresses and all speaking at the same
time</i>.) </p></blockquote>

<p>THE GIRLS</p>

<p>Good-evening, Tyltyl!... We've found you again!... We were so anxious
about you!... We couldn't keep up with you.... Aren't you tired?... May
we kiss you?... Destiny held us back.... I wanted to run.... He stood in
the way.... Aren't you too hot?... Mind you don't catch cold.... Kiss me
too!... And me too!... And me too!...</p>

<p>TYLTYL</p>

<p>(<i>Distributing kisses all round</i>.) My sweethearts!... What darlings you
are, and how happy I feel!... I hope I have not made you walk too
fast?... You must forgive me; I am rather in a hurry.... Jalline dear,
you haven't hurt your foot, have you?... And you, Rosarelle? You are not
used to climbing rocks.... Aimette's hands are cold and Roselle has made
herself much too hot....</p>

<p>LIGHT</p>

<p>Come, we will talk about all this later. We must now hasten to the
Ancestors, who are waiting for us and would be very much annoyed if we
arrived late....</p>

<p>DESTINY</p>

<p>(<i>Who has grown smaller still and is now hardly taller than a man of
average height. He seems very tired and sits huddled on a boulder</i>.) Not
a step farther!...</p>

<p>TYLTYL</p>

<p>Hullo! You've grown a bit smaller again!...</p>

<p>DESTINY</p>

<p>I? I've not changed. I am always the same, I am....</p>

<p>TYLTYL</p>

<p>I know, I know.... It's Light being so near, perhaps....</p>

<p>DESTINY</p>

<p>Light and I have nothing in common.... In any event, I alone am master
and I order a halt....</p>

<p>LIGHT</p>

<p>By all means; there is no need to go any farther. We have arrived; we
are here without taking another step, at the abode of the Ancestors....</p>

<h3><a name="SCENE_VII" id="SCENE_VII"></a>SCENE VII</h3>


<blockquote><p><i>The Abode of the Ancestors</i></p>

<p><i>A large open space, under an Elysian light, which imparts to all
things an aspect of ethereal and lasting felicity and unchanging
gladness. The back and the two sides of the square are formed of
dwelling-places of different periods, some stately, some lowly, but
all radiant and a little unreal. In the foreground, on the right,
for instance, is the entrance to the cottage of</i> TYLTYL'S
<i>grandparents; next comes the gable of a farm-house of older date;
then the front of a little eighteenth-century shop; and thus in
succession, running from right to left and across the back, a
seventeenth-century town-house, a sixteenth-century prison, tavern
and hospital, a fifteenth-century mansion; some thirteenth-century
hovels, a twelfth-century church, a Gallo-Roman farm and villa, and
so on. Intersecting the background at the middle is a street in
endless perspective, bordered with the very oldest houses and
leading to the huts and caves of primitive mankind. In the
foreground are a few stone benches standing under fine trees,
laurels, plane-trees or cypresses</i>.</p>

<p>(TYLTYL, LIGHT, DESTINY <i>and</i> THE SIX GIRLS <i>come forward, followed
at a distance by</i> THE WHITE PHANTOM, <i>who keeps to one side as
usual. They have taken but a few steps when</i> GAFFER <i>and</i> GRANNY
TYL <i>come hurrying out of their cottage and, with exclamations of
delight, throw themselves into</i> TYLTYL'S <i>arms</i>.)
</p></blockquote>

<p>GRANNY TYL</p>

<p>Tyltyl! Tyltyl!... Gracious, you again!... But this time it's not a
surprise. We were expecting you; we were told three days ago....
All the same, though, we're so glad to see you that it's difficult
to believe at first.... But how big and strong you've grown, dear!
And so good-looking: I should never have known you!... Oh, dear,
how nice it is to get a kiss like this now and again!...</p>

<p>GAFFER TYL</p>

<p>Haven't you brought Mytyl this time?...</p>

<p>GRANNY TYL</p>

<p>Of course he hasn't; you know it's not her turn yet.... We know
what you're here for, Tyltyl: it's not to see us! You needn't
blush!... You young rascal, you scamp!... There, there, you're
quite right; and the sooner you set about it the better.... So it's
one of these girls they have to choose?</p>

<p>TYLTYL</p>

<p>Yes, Granny, it seems so.</p>

<p>GAFFER TYL</p>

<p>(<i>Eyeing them like an expert</i>.) Ho, ho!... And, my word, a very
nice lot too! My compliments! I admire your taste.... (<i>Pointing
to</i> ROSELLE.) If I were you, I'd choose that one: she's the
prettiest and the plumpest.</p>

<p>GRANNY TYL</p>

<p>Hold your tongue; no one's asking your advice: you know you've no
say in the matter. We're still too young; we've hardly begun to get
cold and haven't had time yet to pick up things.... It takes so
long; there's so much to learn!... But the others, especially the
oldest, who now are the youngest: it's they who know everything....</p>

<p>TYLTYL</p>

<p>What? The oldest are the youngest in this country?...</p>

<p>GRANNY TYL</p>

<p>Yes, it seems one gets younger as one grows older.... I'm beginning
to notice it myself.</p>

<p>TYLTYL</p>

<p>That's odd.... But where on earth are they?... I see nobody....</p>

<p>GAFFER TYL</p>

<p>They'll come very soon.... I wonder they're not here yet.</p>

<p>TYLTYL</p>

<p>Are there many of them?</p>

<p>GRANNY TYL</p>

<p>What do you think! All your ancestors since the world began!
There'd be so many that we shouldn't know where to put them!... But
we shall only see a few of them. A good many are travelling in
other worlds; and, as a fact, some of the oldest are always away.
But those who are on the spot choose in the name of all. They
always agree; and it seems they very seldom make a mistake.... But
here's one coming out of his house. You see the little man shutting
up his shop?</p>

<blockquote><p>(<i>A spruce</i> LITTLE MAN <i>is seen leaving the eighteenth-century
shop</i>.) </p></blockquote>

<p>TYLTYL</p>

<p>Who's he?</p>

<p>GRANNY TYL</p>

<p>It's your grandfather's grandfather; he was a grocer at Versailles in
the reign of Louis the Fifteenth.</p>

<p>TYLTYL</p>

<p>What funny clothes!</p>

<p>GRANNY TYL</p>

<p>He has put on the things which he wore in his shop.... Here, as a rule,
the weather is so mild, the air so warm and balmy, that we've no need to
dress ourselves; but you wouldn't be able to see us if we had no
clothes; and so, in your honour, we've put on those we used to wear on
earth.... It'll be quite amusing: some of them date back ever so far....
Look, there they come, out of the houses they once lived in....</p>

<blockquote><p>(<i>Enter from the town-house a</i> CITIZEN <i>of the time of Louis XIV;
from the sixteenth-century prison a</i> PRISONER <i>still wearing chains
and irons on his feet and hands. His shackles now seem to be light
and cause him no inconvenience. He attracts</i> TYLTYL'S <i>attention</i>.) </p></blockquote>

<p>TYLTYL</p>

<p>Who is that one? Was he chained up?</p>

<p>GRANNY TYL</p>

<p>Yes, he is one of your ancestors who spent nearly all his life in
prison.</p>

<p>TYLTYL</p>

<p>It's not a thing to boast of; he'd have done better to stay at home.</p>

<p>GRANNY TYL</p>

<p>He did nothing wrong. He used to steal bread or other little things
which one could eat, to keep his children from starving. He suffered a
great deal; we think a lot of him....</p>

<blockquote><p>(THE ANCESTORS <i>continue to leave their houses. An imposing and
richly-dressed</i> MAN <i>appears on the threshold of the
fifteenth-century mansion</i>.) </p></blockquote>

<p>TYLTYL</p>

<p>(<i>Pointing to him</i>.) And that one?</p>

<p>GAFFER TYL</p>

<p>That one is the richest.... It appears we were very rich at one time,
but that didn't last.... However, it doesn't matter here: the only thing
that counts, it seems, is what a man has done or thought.... For
instance, you see those beggars over there, coming out of the church?</p>

<blockquote><p>(<i>Enter from the twelfth-century church some four or five</i> BEGGARS,
<i>clad in rags that are pitiful to look at, but idealized by the
fairy atmosphere</i>.) </p></blockquote>

<p>TYLTYL</p>

<p>Yes, any number of them.</p>

<p>GAFFER TYL</p>

<p>Well, it seems that several generations of us were beggars.... We
succeeded one another, father and son, at the same church and in the
same doorway. It was very good for us, they say. It taught us patience,
resignation, endurance, temperance and the habit of never catching
cold.... But do you see the oldest, the one who looks poorest of all?</p>

<p>TYLTYL</p>

<p>The one with the beautiful white beard?</p>

<p>GAFFER TYL</p>

<p>Precisely.... Well, he's the Great Mendicant, the one whom we respect
most, first because he has an iron constitution and next because he
appears to have thought a very great deal in his corner under the
porch.... They say it's he who did most to develop our brains.</p>

<p>TYLTYL</p>

<p>But I don't see any women among them. Where are their wives? Weren't
they married?</p>

<p>GRANNY TYL</p>

<p>Of course they were; but there's nothing for us women to do to-day. The
men choose the women and the women the men.... When Mytyl comes, it will
be our turn.</p>

<p>TYLTYL</p>

<p>Look, there are three more.</p>

<blockquote><p>(<i>A diseased</i> MAN <i>comes out of the hospital; another, carrying a
bottle and looking rather tipsy, out of the tavern; and, lastly,
out of the prison, a third figure, hairy and savage of aspect,
brandishing a blood-stained knife</i>.) </p></blockquote>

<p>GAFFER TYL</p>

<p>(<i>Dismayed</i>.) I don't like this.... It's very tiresome that they should
have been told....</p>

<p>TYLTYL</p>

<p>Why, who are they?</p>

<p>GAFFER TYL</p>

<p>An ugly lot, those three: the sick man, the drunkard and the
murderer.... They've done us a deal of harm.</p>

<p>TYLTYL</p>

<p>Then there was a murderer in the family?</p>

<p>GAFFER TYL</p>

<p>Of course, as in every family. Fortunately, none of the three has much
influence over us. As you see, they are small and sickly; they shrink
from century to century and are nothing like as healthy as the
others.... But it won't do for them to meddle in your choice.... If the
Great Peasant, the Great Mendicant and the Great Ancestor are there, all
will go well: the others won't dare to breathe a word; if not, they will
try to force their choice upon you and that will be a bad thing for you
and for the future of the entire family.</p>

<blockquote><p>(<i>Enter from the old farm-house a tall</i> PEASANT, <i>dressed in the
mediaeval style. He closes the door carefully and steps forward
whittling a switch</i>.) </p></blockquote>

<p>GAFFER TYL</p>

<p>Here comes the Great Peasant! That's good, that's good!</p>

<p>TYLTYL</p>

<p>That long, thin fellow?</p>

<p>GAFFER TYL</p>

<p>He certainly isn't fat; but he has great influence. He is one of the
mainstays of the family.</p>

<blockquote><p>(<i>Next enter from the villa one or two</i> GALLO-ROMANS <i>and then,
from the hack of the street, among other</i> MEN <i>of the Stone Age, an
exceedingly tall old</i> MAN, <i>dressed in skins and leaning on a heavy
club</i>.) </p></blockquote>

<p>TYLTYL</p>

<p>Why, we've got right back to savages now!</p>

<p>GAFFER TYL</p>

<p>That's the one!</p>

<p>TYLTYL</p>

<p>Who?</p>

<p>GAFFER TYL</p>

<p>The Great Ancestor!</p>

<p>TYLTYL</p>

<p>What? The one like an ape, with the big stick?</p>

<p>GAFFER TYL</p>

<p>You <i>must</i> be quiet!... Don't treat him with disrespect!... It's a great
favour that he's showing you; he doesn't often go out.... Of all our
race he's the most important, the greatest, the most respected....
Everything's shaping well: it'll probably be he, the Great Peasant and
the Great Mendicant who will put their heads together and choose your
bride for you.</p>

<p>TYLTYL</p>

<p>(<i>Indignantly</i>.) But I won't have that!... It doesn't concern them!...
What do they know about it?... A peasant, a savage and a beggar: what
next?</p>

<p>GAFFER TYL</p>

<p>Hold your tongue, I say!... I tell you, they represent all that is best
in you and in the whole family. If you obey them, if you submit to their
influence, you will be happy and safe.... Mind now! They're coming....</p>

<blockquote><p>(THE ANCESTORS <i>have been gradually collecting at the back of the
stage. They bow, accost one another, shake hands, exchange
compliments. All show affectionate respect to</i> THE GREAT PEASANT,
THE GREAT MENDICANT <i>and especially</i> THE GREAT ANCESTOR, <i>gathering
around them and listening deferentially to what they say. On the
other hand</i>, THE SICK MAN, THE DRUNKARD <i>and</i> THE MURDERER <i>are
left standing apart, forming a pitiful rear-guard. The group now
moves towards the benches in the foreground, where</i> TYLTYL <i>and his
companions are gathered</i>.) </p></blockquote>

<p>THE GREAT ANCESTOR</p>

<p>(<i>Coming forward</i>.) Good-evening, Tyltyl!</p>

<p>TYLTYL</p>

<p>Good-evening ... sir!</p>

<p>THE GREAT ANCESTOR</p>

<p>Kiss me first. Don't be afraid. I look rather savage, but it is only a
shape which I had to put on in order to make myself visible to you. I
had no other handy.... But I am really quite clean and I don't smell
bad.</p>

<p>TYLTYL</p>

<p>I never said you did!</p>

<p>THE GREAT ANCESTOR</p>

<p>No, but to judge by the grimace you made you weren't quite sure!...
(<i>Sitting down on the middle bench</i>.) I will sit down here; the Great
Mendicant will take his seat on my right and the Great Peasant on my
left. They don't smell either.... (THE GREAT MENDICANT <i>and</i> THE GREAT
PEASANT <i>take their seats; the other</i> ANCESTORS <i>stand behind him</i>.) And
I will take you on my knees.... I am glad to hold you in my arms for a
moment.... We have known each other so long!</p>

<p>TYLTYL</p>

<p>I don't remember ever seeing you before.</p>

<p>THE GREAT ANCESTOR</p>

<p>And yet we have always lived in each other; for you were already living
in me when I was on earth; and now I live in you while you are still on
that same earth, which we seem to have quitted.... But what do you think
of this place of ours?... Let me have the pleasure of showing you over
your home.</p>

<p>TYLTYL</p>

<p>My home?</p>

<p>THE GREAT ANCESTOR</p>

<p>Certainly.... You are at home here.... And a very nice home it is....
Everything you see&mdash;this square, that prison, the church, those houses,
we who live in them&mdash;all this is really only inside yourself.... People
rarely see it, they don't even suspect it; but it's true.</p>

<p>TYLTYL</p>

<p>I should never have thought there was so much room inside myself and
that it was so large....</p>

<p>THE GREAT ANCESTOR</p>

<p>It's much larger really; there's a great deal that you don't see.... But
that is not what interests us to-day; let us come straight to the point,
to the great question that brings you here.... We are going to choose
the woman whom you are to love....</p>

<p>TYLTYL</p>

<p>Since you are so kind, there's one thing I should like to ask you....</p>

<p>THE GREAT ANCESTOR</p>

<p>Ask me any questions you please.</p>

<p>TYLTYL</p>

<p>How is it that I have not, like other men, the right to choose the woman
I love?</p>

<p>THE GREAT ANCESTOR</p>

<p>But you have the right to choose and are here for the sole purpose of
making that choice.</p>

<p>TYLTYL</p>

<p>No, they tell me that it's you and the others who will make it.</p>

<p>THE GREAT ANCESTOR</p>

<p>But I and the others are all you.... You are we, we are you; and it's
all the same thing.</p>

<p>TYLTYL</p>

<p>Not for me.... They keep on telling me to hold my tongue, that it's not
my business, that it's no concern of mine.... Everybody's allowed to get
a word in, except me.... I've had enough, I'm sick and tired of it!...
Where do I come in? That's what I want to know!</p>

<p>THE GREAT ANCESTOR</p>

<p>You're simply acting as all men act when they think they are doing what
they want to do.</p>

<p>TYLTYL</p>

<p>But, after all, dash it, what business is it of yours? I can understand,
in a way, that the children I may one day have should claim some right
to select their mother; but the rest of you, over here, what difference
can it make to you?</p>

<p>THE GREAT ANCESTOR</p>

<p>Don't you see that it's all the same? Those who have lived in you live
in you just as much as those who are going to. There is no difference,
it all connects and it's still the same family.</p>

<p>TYLTYL</p>

<p>As you please, but I can't make it out.... And, if I refuse to obey, if
I love just for myself, if I take a different girl from the one they
want to force on me, what will they do then? What will happen?</p>

<p>THE GREAT ANCESTOR</p>

<p>Merely this, that the choice you will have made for yourself, without
our approval, will not be a real choice; in other words, you will not
love the woman whom you thought you loved. You will have made a mistake,
you will be unhappy and, at the same time, you will make all of us
unhappy, those who came before you as well as those who come after.</p>

<p>TYLTYL</p>

<p>Does that often happen?</p>

<p>THE GREAT ANCESTOR</p>

<p>Very often, far too often: that is why you see so many unhappy people on
earth.</p>

<p>TYLTYL</p>

<p>Well, what am I to do?</p>

<p>THE GREAT ANCESTOR</p>

<p>Where are your little friends?... Would you mind coming a little nearer,
dear ladies?... (<i>Gazing with attention at</i> THE SIX GIRLS, <i>who come
forward and stand in front of him</i>.) Well, well, you have set us our
task, but you have made it very difficult: how is one to select when all
are equally beautiful?</p>

<p>THE GREAT MENDICANT</p>

<p>They are really very handsome.</p>

<p>THE GREAT PEASANT</p>

<p>And they appear to be very healthy, very quiet and very hard-working.</p>

<p>THE GREAT ANCESTOR</p>

<p>Do you recognize the one among them for whom we are waiting?</p>

<p>THE GREAT MENDICANT</p>

<p>Not yet.</p>

<p>THE GREAT ANCESTOR</p>

<p>It's strange, neither do I.... (<i>To</i> THE GREAT PEASANT.) And you?</p>

<p>THE GREAT PEASANT</p>

<p>I can't say that I don't and I can't say that I do.</p>

<p>THE GREAT ANCESTOR</p>

<p>It's strange, very strange. And yet we know that the one who will make
us happy has arrived and is here among us. We generally recognize her at
the first glance.</p>

<p>THE GREAT MENDICANT</p>

<p>I can't understand it.</p>

<p>THE RICH ANCESTOR</p>

<p>(<i>Standing behind the bench, pointing to</i> ROSARELLE.) Isn't it that
one?... What's your name, my dear?</p>

<p>ROSARELLE</p>

<p>Rosarelle.</p>

<p>THE RICH ANCESTOR</p>

<p>Who are you?</p>

<p>ROSARELLE</p>

<p>The daughter of the Mayor.</p>

<p>THE RICH ANCESTOR</p>

<p>Are you rich?</p>

<p>ROSARELLE</p>

<p>My father has money, I believe.</p>

<p>THE RICH ANCESTOR</p>

<p>You see? There is no doubt about it.</p>

<p>THE SICK ANCESTOR</p>

<p>(<i>Pointing to</i> AIMETTE.) I say it's that one.</p>

<p>THE DRUNKEN ANCESTOR</p>

<p>(<i>Taking hold of</i> ROSELLE.) This is the one I want.</p>

<p>THE MURDERER ANCESTOR</p>

<p>(<i>Leaping over the bench and taking hold of</i> BELLINE.) And I take this
one!</p>

<p>THE GREAT ANCESTOR</p>

<p>(<i>Rising, in an authoritative tone</i>.) Be silent ... and withdraw!...
<i>(With an imperious gesture</i>.) Begone!... You know that you have lost
the right to raise your voice in my presence!...</p>

<blockquote><p>(<i>The four dissentient</i> ANCESTORS, <i>addressed in these terms, move
away crestfallen</i>.) </p></blockquote>

<p>THE OTHER ANCESTORS</p>

<p>(<i>Grouped behind the bench, clapping their hands</i>.) Hear! Hear!... Well
done!... It's what they deserve!... They have been wrong too often!...
They have done too much harm!... They would be the ruin of the
family!...</p>

<p>JALLINE</p>

<p>(<i>Going to</i> THE GREAT MENDICANT <i>and clasping his knees</i>.) Perhaps I'm
the one.... I love him so!</p>

<p>MILETTE</p>

<p>(<i>Going to</i> THE GREAT PEASANT <i>and clasping his knees</i>.) If you want to
know how much I love him, look at me and see.</p>

<p>AIMETTE</p>

<p>(<i>Going to</i> THE GREAT ANCESTOR <i>and clasping his knees</i>.) Can't you see
that I have loved him longer than the others? I have loved him since I
first set eyes on him. I never dared say so; but I feel that I shall die
if you choose another.</p>

<p>THE GREAT ANCESTOR</p>

<p>My poor children, it is very sad, but my hands are tied. You will
perhaps cry for a few hours; but, if we chose one of you, she would
spend her whole life crying, for I do not see among you the one for whom
we are waiting.... Tyltyl!</p>

<p>TYLTYL</p>

<p>Yes?</p>

<p>THE GREAT ANCESTOR</p>

<p>Have you brought us no one else, besides those we see here?</p>

<p>TYLTYL</p>

<p>No, no one else.</p>

<p>THE GREAT MENDICANT</p>

<p>I see a tall white figure over there, against a tree; who is it?</p>

<p>TYLTYL</p>

<p>I really don't know. She follows us all the time, squeezes in wherever
we go, nobody knows her; and we can't get rid of her.</p>

<p>THE GREAT ANCESTOR</p>

<p>Go and fetch her.</p>

<blockquote><p>(TYLTYL <i>fetches</i> THE WHITE PHANTOM <i>and brings her back, holding
her by the hand</i>.) </p></blockquote>

<p>THE GREAT ANCESTOR</p>

<p>Who are you?</p>

<p>TYLTYL</p>

<p>It's no use asking her. She never answers; she can't talk.</p>

<p>THE GREAT ANCESTOR</p>

<p>(<i>To</i> THE PHANTOM.) Come nearer, child, and let me lift the veil that
covers your face.... (<i>He removes the veil. The statue's face appears,
absolutely white, featureless and devoid of human expression</i>.) She has
no face.... (<i>To the other</i> ANCESTORS <i>standing around them</i>.) Do you
know her?</p>

<p>THE GREAT PEASANT</p>

<p>She has no expression.</p>

<p>THE GREAT MENDICANT</p>

<p>She has no features.... She is like an unfinished statue.</p>

<p>THE GREAT ANCESTOR</p>

<p>What are we to do? It must be she. But who is she? She is not dead, or
we should know it.... Come, Tyltyl, make an effort, for everything
depends on you. You must remember....</p>

<p>TYLTYL</p>

<p>I have tried my utmost.... Do what I will, I can't remember at all.</p>

<p>THE GREAT ANCESTOR</p>

<p>Listen, it is a serious matter. If we do not succeed in recognizing her,
all your life, all your happiness on earth will be nothing more than a
phantom like herself.... There is one last resource, one last hope,
which is that the children who are to be born of you may discover who
she is and that she is to be their mother. They see much farther and
deeper than we. But there is no time to lose; for this waiting and this
living in suspense are very dangerous for her. We must be quick
therefore; we must not waste a moment ... go, my little Tyltyl. You have
been very good and patient, very obedient and faithful to your race
throughout this ordeal. Take this kiss and farewell.... You too, my
dears, let me give you the parting kiss. Do not be too sad; another
happiness awaits you. There is more than one kind on that poor misguided
earth of yours. You have deserved every happiness that it can give....
Good-bye, my dear daughters; good-bye, good-bye, my son. And we will
meet again whenever you wish: you know where to find us and we shall be
waiting for you....</p>

<h3>ACT IV</h3>



<h3><a name="SCENE_VIII" id="SCENE_VIII"></a>SCENE VIII</h3>


<blockquote><p><i>Before the Curtain representing the Milky Way</i></p>

<p>(<i>Enter</i> TYLTYL <i>and</i> LIGHT.) </p></blockquote>

<p>TYLTYL</p>

<p>Where are we?</p>

<p>LIGHT</p>

<p>Near to the stars and yet within yourself. Before you is the great veil
of the Milky Way. Beyond it stretches the region in which your unborn
children are waiting to show you the mother whom they have chosen.</p>

<p>TYLTYL</p>

<p>It's a little like the Kingdom of the Future in "The Blue Bird."</p>

<p>LIGHT</p>

<p>Perhaps; and yet not quite the same thing. There it was the whole
kingdom, with everybody's children; here it is only a province, in which
are no children but yours.</p>

<p>TYLTYL</p>

<p>Have I many?</p>

<p>LIGHT</p>

<p>As many children as you have ancestors, as innumerable and no less
infinite. But, as with the Ancestors, we shall see only those who are
nearest to you, especially the youngest and smallest.</p>

<p>TYLTYL</p>

<p>Why the smallest?</p>

<p>LIGHT</p>

<p>Because they are nearest to their birth. As this approaches, they grow
smaller and younger; so that the youngest, who are the first to be born,
can hardly walk or stand.</p>

<p>TYLTYL</p>

<p>And the others? Are there any big ones?</p>

<p>LIGHT</p>

<p>There are children of all sizes, but I do not know that we shall see the
biggest, that is to say, those who will be born hundreds or thousands of
years hence.... There will not have been time to tell them; they do not
keep close to the doors, like the very little ones, but wander far away
waiting for their time to come.</p>

<p>TYLTYL</p>

<p>They must find it very tiresome to be kept waiting like that!</p>

<p>LIGHT</p>

<p>Nothing is ever tiresome in infinity. Besides they have to learn here
all that they will forget on earth.</p>

<p>TYLTYL</p>

<p>It seems hardly worth while then, to take so much trouble!</p>

<p>LIGHT</p>

<p>Oh, but it is! Something always remains and helps to build up the deep
happiness of life.</p>

<p>TYLTYL</p>

<p>Well, so much the better for them! As for me, I shall soon know what I
am to do. I hope we shall get through to-day, because, you see, I'd like
to have things settled.... But where on earth can they be, those girls
of mine and Destiny? (<i>Looking below him, on the right</i>.) The poor
little dears are up to their knees in the snow. This place is even
higher and more difficult to get at than where the Ancestors lived.</p>

<p>LIGHT</p>

<p>(<i>Looking down</i>.) They are not very far away.... But you have taken off
your hat again; that's a bad habit of yours. Put it on quickly, before
they come, and be careful to make no mistake this time, for, if you do,
the result may be very unpleasant.</p>

<blockquote><p>(TYLTYL <i>puts on his hat and turns the sapphire. Forthwith from the
earth and from every side little creatures of different sizes
appear, dressed like him and resembling him in nearly every
respect. They surround him, rush against him, hustle him and try to
drag him, some to the right, others to the left, while he struggles
in the midst of them without knowing to which he should give his
attention</i>.) </p></blockquote>

<p>TYLTYL</p>

<p>(<i>Distraught</i>.) Hullo, hullo, what's all this? What does it mean? That
sapphire really is becoming impossible!</p>

<p>LIGHT</p>

<p>Don't worry: you'll have turned it the wrong way again. What did you do?</p>

<p>TYLTYL</p>

<p>How can I tell?... This is getting too much for me! Too mixed up,
really.... I must have pressed it instead of turning it.</p>

<p>LIGHT</p>

<p>That's what I thought. You have simply released some of your other
"You's."</p>

<p>TYLTYL</p>

<p>(<i>Dumbfounded</i>.) Some of my other "Me's"?</p>

<p>LIGHT</p>

<p>Yes, what I mean is that you are not alone inside yourself and that....</p>

<p>TYLTYL</p>

<p>(<i>More and more dumbfounded</i>.) I am not alone inside myself?...</p>

<p>LIGHT</p>

<p>Why, no, there are a number of other personalities there, more or less
like you and all the time trying to get the upper hand.</p>

<p>TYLTYL</p>

<p>No, but really, what else is there inside me? I must be a sort of
menagerie or Noah's ark! There's no end to it!</p>

<p>LIGHT</p>

<p>That's true: there would be no end if we had the time to go into it
all.... But press the sapphire down now and all will be well.</p>

<blockquote><p>(TYLTYL <i>presses the sapphire and all his</i> DOUBLES <i>disappear</i>.) </p></blockquote>

<p>TYLTYL</p>

<p>My word! A good riddance!... Well, as you say, they may be the least bit
like me, but some of them are very ugly. Particularly a big dark one,
who kept on tripping me up and very nearly made me fall.</p>

<p>LIGHT</p>

<p>Of course, there are some of all kinds, as in every man. One must learn
to choose the best and avoid the worst.... But here come your little
friends.</p>

<blockquote><p>(<i>Enter first</i> THE WHITE PHANTOM.) </p></blockquote>

<p>TYLTYL</p>

<p>(<i>Amazed</i>.) Hullo!... What's the matter with her?... She seems quite in
a hurry to-day and moves like an angel.</p>

<blockquote><p>(<i>Enter next</i> MILETTE, BELLINE, ROSELLE <i>and</i> ROSARELLE, <i>followed
by</i> AIMETTE <i>and</i> Jalline, <i>who are supporting</i> DESTINY <i>between
them. He is now a head shorter than</i> TYLTYL, <i>wears the same tragic
costume as before, seems very weary and sinks down on a heap of
snow</i>.) </p></blockquote>

<p>TYLTYL</p>

<p>(<i>Going to him, with a certain solicitude</i>.) Are you ill?</p>

<p>DESTINY</p>

<p>I? Not at all: I am always the same, I am unchangeable.... But when you
alone are responsible for everything, when you have to manage
everything, direct everything and foresee everything and when nobody
helps you (<i>casting an aggressive eye on</i> LIGHT), you are entitled to a
moment's rest.... I therefore order a halt. It is decided irrevocably:
to-day we go no farther.</p>

<p>LIGHT Admirable! And so it shall be, for we have arrived; and with
Destiny's permission, we shall find ourselves, without taking another
step, among the children who are awaiting us....</p>

<blockquote><p><i>The Abode of the Children</i></p>

<p><i>The immense halls, the lofty vaults, the infinite perspectives of
arches and columns of the Kingdom of the Future in "The Blue Bird";
but this time, it being the nuptial hour, everything is of a soft,
milky white, gleaming and transparent. The radiant shapes of
amber-coloured light bathe in unspeakable gladness all the things
that they touch; and everywhere are signs of a deep and unfaltering
joy. The boundless horizon stretches towards the veiled white of
the Milky Way, the ether quivering with myriads of unknown stars</i>.</p>

<p>(<i>When the curtain opens</i>, TYLTYL, LIGHT, DESTINY <i>and</i> THE SIX
GIRLS <i>are in the foreground, on the right, at the foot of one of
the alabaster columns supporting the entrance-arch. They take a few
steps into the immense deserted hall, while</i> THE WHITE PHANTOM
<i>hides timidly behind the column</i>.) </p></blockquote>

<p>TYLTYL</p>

<p>(<i>A little disappointed</i>.) There's nobody here!...</p>

<p>LIGHT</p>

<p>I know why it is. There are several doors; as you were all very tired, I
chose the one that was nearest. They are probably waiting for us at the
principal entrance.</p>

<p>TYLTYL</p>

<p>How shall we let them know?</p>

<p>LIGHT</p>

<p>The atmosphere will do that: here everything is known immediately and
every event happens everywhere at the same moment.</p>

<p>TYLTYL</p>

<p>It's a very fine place, this: splendid large rooms and a very high
ceiling; lots of light and air....</p>

<p>LIGHT</p>

<p>And it's still always inside yourself.</p>

<p>TYLTYL</p>

<p>What, this is inside me too?</p>

<p>LIGHT</p>

<p>Why, yes; of course it is.</p>

<p>TYLTYL</p>

<p>Very well, then; that's all right. Please step in: you're very welcome.
Won't you sit down while you wait?</p>

<p>LIGHT</p>

<p>We shall not have long to wait, for I believe they have seen us.</p>

<blockquote><p>(A CHILD'S <i>head appears for an instant between two columns and is
then briskly withdrawn, exclaiming</i>, "This way! This way! They're
here!" <i>Soon after, seven or eight</i> CHILDREN <i>of about twelve years
of age, in short white tunics, with bare arms, legs and feet, run
up from the back of the hall and stop in front of the visitors. The
largest holds out his hand to</i> TYLTYL.) </p></blockquote>

<p>THE CHILD</p>

<p>Good-evening, grandpapa!</p>

<p>TYLTYL</p>

<p>Grandpapa?... Who's that?... Where is he?...</p>

<p>THE CHILD</p>

<p>(<i>Bursting into laughter</i>.) Why, it's you!</p>

<p>TYLTYL</p>

<p>(<i>Dumbfounded</i>.) I? Am I a grandpapa already?</p>

<p>THE CHILD</p>

<p>Of course you are, eighty times over!... We are the first to arrive. The
others are on their way.... (<i>To the other</i> CHILDREN.) He doesn't seem
to believe it!</p>

<p>ANOTHER CHILD</p>

<p>You might give us a kiss.</p>

<p>TYLTYL</p>

<p>(<i>Kissing them all</i>.) I will! I will!... But how do I come to be a
grandpapa?</p>

<p>THE CHILD</p>

<p>Surely it's quite simple: you will be our grandpapa when we are your
grandchildren.</p>

<p>TYLTYL</p>

<p>Obviously, that's clear.... So you exist already?</p>

<p>THE CHILD</p>

<p>Naturally, since you yourself exist.... I say, are those the grandmammas
you're bringing us?</p>

<p>TYLTYL</p>

<p>Yes; it seems you're to pick out the best one.</p>

<p>ANOTHER CHILD</p>

<p>(<i>Clapping his hands and dancing for joy</i>.) Oh, how pretty they are!...
(<i>Throwing himself into</i> JALLINE'S <i>arms</i>.) I take this one, because she
is so soft!...</p>

<p>ANOTHER CHILD</p>

<p>(<i>Throwing his arms round</i> AIMETTE'S <i>neck</i>.) And I this one, because
she is so sad!...</p>

<p>ANOTHER CHILD</p>

<p>(<i>Kissing</i> ROSELLE.) I choose this one, because's she's always
laughing!...</p>

<p>THREE OTHER CHILDREN</p>

<p>(<i>Each taking one of</i> THE GIRLS, <i>kissing and fondling her and laughing
and skipping with delight</i>.) And I choose this one, because she smells
so nice!... I choose this one!... I choose this one!...</p>

<p>THE FIRST CHILD</p>

<p>(<i>Intervening</i>.) One moment, one moment, if you please.... This has
nothing to do with us; our turn will come. You know that only the
smallest have the right to choose who is to be their mother. All we have
to do is to help them with our advice and to stop them if they make
mistakes; but that's a thing which has never happened yet. They were
quite some distance away, at the principal gate, but they won't be long
now.</p>

<p>TYLTYL</p>

<p>Here come some bigger ones!</p>

<blockquote><p>(<i>Enter a new group of</i> CHILDREN, <i>apparently about fifteen years
of age. The oldest goes to</i> TYLTYL <i>and shakes hands with him</i>.) </p></blockquote>

<p>THE OLDEST CHILD</p>

<p>Good-evening, great-grandfather!...</p>

<p>TYLTYL</p>

<p>Who's that? I? I'm a great-grandfather now!...</p>

<p>THE OLDEST CHILD</p>

<p>Of course you are!... I am very glad to see you for a minute, for we
shall most nicely not have the pleasure of meeting on earth.... Well, I
understand that your visit to the Ancestors was not much of a success.</p>

<p>TYLTYL</p>

<p>Let's rather put it that they hadn't quite made up their minds. But how
is it that you already know what happened there?</p>

<p>THE OLDEST CHILD</p>

<p>Why, of course we know everything that happens inside you; we're there
ourselves. Besides, there's very little that separates us from the
Ancestors: our interests are the same and our paths often meet.</p>

<p>THE FIRST CHILD</p>

<p>Look out! Here are the little ones!... I see five coming.... There's
only one missing, the littlest....</p>

<blockquote><p>(<i>From the back of the halls come five</i> LITTLE CHILDREN <i>holding
one another's hands</i>.) </p></blockquote>

<p>TYLTYL</p>

<p>Who are those five little ones? They are very sweet.</p>

<p>THE FIRST CHILD</p>

<p>Why, they are your children: two boys and three girls!</p>

<p>TYLTYL</p>

<p>Mine? Shall I have five children?</p>

<p>THE FIRST CHILD</p>

<p>Six, you will have six, for the last little one isn't here yet.... I
promise you, the world can do with them, after what people have been up
to, down there!...</p>

<p>TYLTYL</p>

<p>But I shall never be able to feed them all!...</p>

<blockquote><p>(THE FIVE LITTLE ONES, <i>still holding hands, have stopped in front
of</i> THE SIX GIRLS <i>and stand looking at them solemnly, without
speaking. By degrees, the halls have become filled with a host of
other</i> CHILDREN <i>who gather round</i> THE FIVE LITTLE ONES <i>and watch
them. The silence at last becomes irksome and</i> TYLTYL <i>breaks it</i>.) </p></blockquote>

<p>TYLTYL</p>

<p>Well, children, aren't you going to kiss your papa?</p>

<p>THE YOUNGEST CHILD</p>

<p>(<i>Ordering him with a serious gesture to be silent</i>.) Mamma first....
Where is she?</p>

<p>TYLTYL</p>

<p>Why, she must be here; she's one of those. You have only to choose.</p>

<p>THE YOUNGEST CHILD</p>

<p>(<i>To the one beside him</i>.) Do you see her?</p>

<p>THE OTHER</p>

<p>(<i>Shaking his head sadly</i>.) No.</p>

<p>THE THREE OTHERS</p>

<p>(<i>In succession</i>.) No more do I.... No more do I.... No more do I....</p>

<p>JALLINE</p>

<p>(<i>Rushing forward, catching hold of one of the</i> CHILDREN <i>and kissing
him</i>.) But that's impossible!... Here, look at me?... Don't you see how
much I'll love you?...</p>

<p>THE CHILD</p>

<p>Yes, but you're not the one.</p>

<p>ROSELLE</p>

<p>(<i>Taking another</i> CHILD <i>on her knees</i>.) And me? Won't you have me for
your mamma?</p>

<p>THE CHILD</p>

<p>No, no, it's not you.</p>

<p>ROSARELLE</p>

<p>(<i>Catching hold of another</i> CHILD.) And me? Don't you love me? You'll
see how happy we shall be!... We shall have a lovely house full of toys
and I shall give you everything you want....</p>

<p>THE CHILD</p>

<p>(<i>Vainly trying to contain its tears</i>.) No, no!...</p>

<p>BELLINE</p>

<p>(<i>Taking</i> THE YOUNGEST.) Look here, you seem to know more than the
others.... Don't you recognize me?... Are you fond of sweets?...</p>

<p>THE YOUNGEST CHILD</p>

<p>(<i>Struggling until she lets him go and crying without disguise</i>.) Let me
go! Let me go!</p>

<p>TYLTYL</p>

<p>Here's a pretty business! He's crying!... And the other one as well!...
But what do they want?... They're very hard to please....</p>

<p>ONE OF THE BIG CHILDREN</p>

<p>They are going to the other door.</p>

<p>They are going to fetch the smallest of them all.</p>

<p>ANOTHER</p>

<p>The smaller they are, the more they know.</p>

<p>THE FIRST CHILD</p>

<p>But where is he, the smallest one? Haven't you seen him?</p>

<p>ANOTHER</p>

<p>No, no one has seen him since this morning.... It's strange, for he is
always with his little sisters.</p>

<p>TYLTYL</p>

<p>(<i>Looking at the throng of</i> CHILDREN <i>filling the halls</i>.) How many
there are!</p>

<p>ONE OF THE BIG CHILDREN</p>

<p>It's only one part of the family.</p>

<p>A CHILD</p>

<p>(<i>Which has been following the progress of</i> THE FIVE CHILDREN <i>with his
eyes</i>.) They are stopping at the third door.</p>

<p>TYLTYL</p>

<p>Who?</p>

<p>THE CHILD</p>

<p>The five little ones.</p>

<p>ANOTHER CHILD</p>

<p>They seem to be looking for something.</p>

<p>Yes, yes, let us all go.... They know, they know!</p>

<p>JALLINE</p>

<p>(<i>Passing</i> DESTINY <i>to</i> MILETTE.) Will you take him for a moment? He's
not very big, but dreadfully heavy.</p>

<p>MILETTE</p>

<p>(<i>Taking him from</i> JALLINE'S <i>arms</i>.) Come to me, my little Tiny, come;
there, don't cry....</p>

<p>DESTINY</p>

<p>(<i>In a whining baby voice</i>.) Me? I never cwy!... I'm alwayth the
thame!... I'm unthakable, immovable, indefatigable, implacable and
inegthowable!...</p>

<p>MILETTE</p>

<p>Yes, yes, Tiny, we know, you're a very good little boy.... (DESTINY
<i>falls asleep in her arms</i>.) He's gone to sleep!</p>

<p>JALLINE</p>

<p>(<i>Wrapping him in his cape, with a motherly gesture</i>.) He's a dear,
sweet, obedient little thing, but seems very tired.</p>

<p>LIGHT</p>

<p>Poor little Destiny!... He has no luck!... But we will see to him
later.... What we have to do now, my children, is to bid one another
good-bye ... and for the last time....</p>

<p>TYLTYL</p>

<p>For the last time!...</p>

<p>LIGHT</p>

<p>Why, yes; we can't spend our whole life travelling! Besides, you are
near your homes, since you all of you dwell round the forest. We have
learned what we sought and we know what we wanted to know, that man is
granted only one love, while the others are merely unfortunate errors
that bring sorrow to innumerable lives.... You were all of you about to
choose wrongly; and you may rejoice, therefore, even now, when we have
to part, that the mistake was discovered before it was too late.... And,
more than this, the Fairy has charged me with glad tidings for you all:
the one love you have each of you sought is waiting for you by your own
fire-side, in your own home, or at least will be there very soon.... So
do not linger, but hasten to meet it.... The hour grows late; soon the
cocks will be crowing; the birds are beginning to wake. Let us bid one
another good-bye, quickly, without regret, without sad thoughts or
tears....</p>

<p>MILETTE</p>

<p>(<i>Handing</i> DESTINY <i>to</i> AIMETTE.) Just take him for a minute, while I
kiss TYLTYL.... (<i>Kissing</i> TYLTYL.) Good-bye, Tyltyl dear. I must go
first. Dad gets up early and there would be awful trouble if he didn't
find me in the house. Good-bye. Let me kiss you again.... Be nice to me
when we meet: we're neighbours and shall have to spend all our lives in
this forest.</p>

<p>TYLTYL</p>

<p>(<i>Kissing her affectionately</i>.) Be nice to you, Milette? Of course I
will! It's not your fault or mine: we both know that.</p>

<p>MILETTE</p>

<p>Good-bye, good-bye!... I must fly!...</p>

<blockquote><p>(<i>She runs out</i>.) </p></blockquote>

<p>AIMETTE</p>

<p>(<i>Handing</i> DESTINY <i>to</i> JALLINE.) Take hold of the little man for a
second, will you? (<i>Kissing</i> TYLTYL.) Good-bye, Tyltyl.... Don't let us
forget each other.... I shall perhaps love somebody else; but I shall
never love him as I loved you.</p>

<p>LIGHT</p>

<p>Come, come, you are wasting time.... We shall never have done if we go
on like this.... If the cock crows before you return, your parents will
know everything; and then they'll be angry.... Just give him a sisterly
kiss: that's all that's necessary.... You're not going far; and you'll
meet again many a time, in real life, and will like each other the
better because of your truer knowledge....</p>

<p>LIGHT</p>

<p>Well, Jalline, what are you doing here?</p>

<p>JALLINE</p>

<p>I can't go away at once, just like the others!...</p>

<p>LIGHT</p>

<p>But you must, dear Jalline. Not because it is fate, as men say, but
because it is the will of those who know everything and who never
die.... Good-bye, my little Jalline. You have been very sweet, very
loving, very exquisite; and I thought that you would be chosen.... Don't
cry, dear. Hand over poor little Destiny to me, I will take care of him;
and give Tyltyl a long, long kiss....</p>

<p>JALLINE</p>

<p>(<i>Hands</i> DESTINY <i>to</i> LIGHT <i>and gives</i> TYLTYL <i>a long kiss</i>.) Good-bye,
Tyltyl.</p>

<p>Good-bye, Jalline!</p>

<blockquote><p>(JALLINE <i>moves away with slow reluctant steps</i>.) </p></blockquote>

<p>LIGHT</p>

<p>And, now that we are alone, let me kiss you too.... We shall meet once
again to take another and a longer journey....</p>

<p>TYLTYL</p>

<p>Another journey? And a longer one?</p>

<p>LIGHT</p>

<p>The last, the happiest and the most beautiful. But I am not allowed to
speak of it yet.... Good-bye, Tyltyl. Remember, dear, that you are not
alone in this world and that all that you see in it has neither
beginning nor end. With this thought in your heart, letting it grow with
your growth, you will always know, whatever may happen, the right thing
to say, the right thing to hope for.... And you, Tiny, don't cry like
that! Some day we shall begin to understand each other.</p>

<h3><a name="SCENE_XI" id="SCENE_XI"></a>SCENE XI</h3>


<blockquote><p><i>The Awakening</i></p>

<p><i>The same scene as in Act I</i>. TYLTYL <i>is sound asleep. The light
trickles gaily through all the crannies of the closed shutters. The
Blue Bird is singing madly in his cage</i>.</p>

<p>(<i>A knock at the door</i>.) </p></blockquote>

<p>TYLTYL</p>

<p>(<i>Waking with a start</i>.) Who's there?</p>

<p>MUMMY TYL</p>

<p>(<i>Behind the door</i>.) It's me!... Open the door quickly!... We're
expecting a visitor....</p>

<p>TYLTYL</p>

<p>Wait, wait, till I slip on my breeches.... (<i>Rising and seeing with
amazement that he is dressed</i>.) Hullo, I've gone to bed with my clothes
on! How did I come to do that?...</p>

<blockquote><p>(<i>He opens the door. Enter</i> MUMMY TYL <i>fussily, carrying a bundle
of sticks</i>.) </p></blockquote>

<p>MUMMY TYL</p>

<p>Quick, quick!... Help me light the fire and tidy the room.... Go and
wake up Mytyl.... They'll be here in a minute.</p>

<p>TYLTYL</p>

<p>(<i>Doing his best to help her</i>.) Who's "they"?</p>

<p>MUMMY TYL</p>

<p>Of course, you don't know. Daddy Tyl met them yesterday, but you had
gone to bed.... Do open the shutters, I can't see what I'm doing....
(TYLTYL <i>opens the shutters and the daylight floods the room</i>.) And call
Mytyl, so that she can help me to get things straight.... What a
mess!... And the dust! I can't let them see my house like this. (<i>Enter</i>
MYTYL.)</p>

<p>TYLTYL</p>

<p>Hullo, there Mytyl is!... But you haven't told me....</p>

<p>MUMMY TYL</p>

<p>(<i>To</i> MYTYL.) The fire's beginning to burn up.... You make the coffee,
while I start cleaning.... What's this? More cabbage leaves under the
tap!</p>

<p>MYTYL</p>

<p>It's not my fault. Tyltyl promised me....</p>

<p>MUMMY TYL</p>

<p>Well, I never! A nice thing!... It's a blessing that I came to look for
myself!... Take the broom, Tyltyl, while I give a rub to the plates and
put them away.</p>

<p>TYLTYL</p>

<p>But look here: who's coming? Is it the Shah of Persia or the Emperor of
China?</p>

<p>MUMMY TYL</p>

<p>Much better than that. You'll never guess.... Do you remember our
neighbour?</p>

<p>MYTYL</p>

<p>What neighbour?</p>

<p>MUMMY TYL</p>

<p>There aren't so many of 'em.... The one with the pretty little pink
house, by the road-side, and a garden full of sunflowers and hollyhocks.</p>

<p>TYLTYL</p>

<p>Of course!... And they had a little girl to whom I gave my dove?</p>

<p>MUMMY TYL</p>

<p>That's right.</p>

<p>TYLTYL</p>

<p>They've been gone a long time.</p>

<p>MUMMY TYL</p>

<p>Five or six years, that's all. They went to the town to live with the
girl's uncle. He was a widower, with no children of his own, and has
died and left them all his money. They told Daddy Tyl they're coming
back here for good, going into their nice little house again. It
belonged to little Joy's uncle.</p>

<p>TYLTYL</p>

<p>Little Joy?</p>

<p>MUMMY TYL</p>

<p>Yes, yes, you know: that's the little girl's name. They used to call her
Jojo when she was small; but her name is Joy. Daddy Tyl met her last
night, says that he could hardly believe his eyes, that she's taller
than you and beautiful ... well, there! With hair like gold, real gold!
That's worth thinking about.... So I want the house tidy and all of us
to look decent and respectable.... You can never tell what may happen.
We're of good stock too. Your grandfather's father was a pork-butcher.</p>

<p>TYLTYL</p>

<p>It's curious, I didn't meet him.</p>

<p>MUMMY TYL</p>

<p>Whom?</p>

<p>TYLTYL</p>

<p>My grandfather's father.</p>

<p>MUMMY TYL</p>

<p>That's not to be wondered at: he's been dead these fifty-seven years.</p>

<p>TYLTYL</p>

<p>(<i>Sweeping the floor lustily</i>.) Perhaps I had better put on my Sunday
clothes?</p>

<p>MUMMY TYL</p>

<p>No, you needn't; you're all right as you are. We'll just lay the white
tablecloth.... Besides, there's no time now; here they come; I can hear
them walking up the path.</p>

<blockquote><p>(<i>A knock at the door</i>. MUMMY TYL <i>opens it. Enter</i> THE NEIGHBOUR
<i>and</i> JOY, <i>followed by</i> DADDY TYL, <i>with his axe on his
shoulder</i>.) </p></blockquote>

<p>DADDY TYL</p>

<p>(<i>Calling out from the threshold</i>.) Here they are! Here they are!</p>

<p>THE NEIGHBOUR</p>

<p>Yes, it's Joy and I, Madame Tyl.... Good-morning, a Merry Christmas and
good luck to everybody, as my poor husband used to say when he was
alive. I'm glad to see you looking so well.... And these are the
children? Don't tell me that this great, big, pretty girl is Mytyl? And
can that be Tyltyl, that strapping young fellow who looks so smart?</p>

<p>MUMMY TYL</p>

<p>Yes, yes, Madame Berlingot, they're the sort that keep on shooting up
till you don't know where you are. Tyltyl hasn't grown as much as his
sister; but he's stronger. There's not a sturdier lad in all the
country-side.... But it's your young lady who's beautiful!... She looks
the very picture of the blessed saints!... (<i>Observing</i> TYLTYL, <i>who
stands wide-eyed and entranced</i>.) Now then, Tyltyl, where are your
manners? Don't you, know your little playmate? Be civil, say
how-do-you-do, shake hands and give her a chair.</p>

<p>DADDY TYL</p>

<p>Before you sit down, would you like to see the cows?</p>

<p>THE NEIGHBOUR</p>

<p>What, do you keep cows now?</p>

<p>DADDY TYL</p>

<p>Why, yes; we've not done so badly either.... Two little cows and a
calf.... Little cows are better than big ones; and they only eat half as
much.... One of them, the red one, gives us twenty quarts of milk every
day.</p>

<p>THE NEIGHBOUR</p>

<p>Then you've put up a cow-house? You hadn't one before.</p>

<p>DADDY TYL</p>

<p>Yes, I ran it up myself, with Tyltyl to help.... (<i>Leading her towards
the door on the left</i>.) It's this way: we made a good job of it and it's
quite worth seeing.</p>

<p>THE NEIGHBOUR</p>

<p>Dear me, yes; I'd like to see it at once.</p>

<blockquote><p>(<i>They all go out, except</i> TYLTYL <i>and</i> JOY, <i>who remain standing
face to face. As soon as they are gone</i>, TYLTYL <i>goes up to</i> JOY
<i>and takes her hand</i>.) </p></blockquote>

<p>TYLTYL</p>

<p>Is it ... really you?</p>

<p>JOY</p>

<p>Yes, it's I.</p>

<p>TYLTYL</p>

<p>I knew you at once.</p>

<p>JOY</p>

<p>And I you.</p>

<p>TYLTYL</p>

<p>You are even more beautiful than up there.</p>

<p>JOY</p>

<p>You too.</p>

<p>TYLTYL</p>

<p>I say, it's funny that I couldn't remember....</p>

<p>JOY</p>

<p>I hadn't forgotten.</p>

<p>TYLTYL</p>

<p>Oh, how lovely you are!... Let me kiss you.</p>

<p>JOY</p>

<p>You may if you like.</p>

<blockquote><p>(<i>They kiss each other awkwardly, but affectionately</i>.) </p></blockquote>

<p>TYLTYL</p>

<p>They haven't a suspicion.</p>

<p>JOY</p>

<p>You think that?</p>

<p>TYLTYL</p>

<p>I'm sure of it. They don't know what we know. But the little ones knew.</p>

<p>JOY</p>

<p>What little ones?</p>

<p>TYLTYL</p>

<p>The little ones up there.... They were very clever. They knew you at
once.... Were you so very unhappy?</p>

<p>JOY</p>

<p>Why?</p>

<p>TYLTYL</p>

<p>Because I couldn't remember.</p>

<p>JOY</p>

<p>It wasn't your fault.</p>

<p>TYLTYL</p>

<p>I know, but I hated it.... And you were so pale, so dreadfully pale; and
you never spoke.... How long had you loved me?</p>

<p>JOY</p>

<p>Ever since I first saw you, when you gave me the Blue Bird.</p>

<p>TYLTYL</p>

<p>So have I, so have I, but I had forgotten.... Never mind: we're going to
be tremendously happy, for they've settled it, you see; they want it.</p>

<p>JOY</p>

<p>Do you think they've done it on purpose?</p>

<p>TYLTYL</p>

<p>I'm quite sure; there isn't a doubt.... Everybody wanted it, but
especially the little ones, all six of them.</p>

<p>JOY</p>

<p>Oh!</p>

<p>TYLTYL</p>

<p>Yes!... We're going to have six!... I say, do you believe it?</p>

<p>JOY</p>

<p>Six what?</p>

<p>TYLTYL</p>

<p>Why, six children, of course!</p>

<p>JOY</p>

<p>Oh, Tyltyl!</p>

<p>TYLTYL</p>

<p>I know it's a great many; but we'll manage somehow. There's nothing to
be afraid of.... What a dream, eh?</p>

<p>JOY</p>

<p>Yes.</p>

<p>TYLTYL</p>

<p>The loveliest I ever had; and you?</p>

<p>JOY</p>

<p>Yes.</p>

<p>TYLTYL</p>

<p>I saw you as you are now, just like that. But here, all the same, you
are more real and more beautiful.... Oh, I must kiss you again!</p>

<blockquote><p>(<i>They kiss each other lingeringly. At that moment</i> DADDY TYL
<i>opens the door, with the others behind him</i>.) </p></blockquote>

<p>DADDY TYL</p>

<p>(<i>Catching them in the act</i>.) Well, I never!... You're getting on, you
two!... You're losing no time!</p>

<p>THE NEIGHBOUR</p>

<p>(<i>Entering with</i> MUMMY TYL <i>and</i> MYTYL.) What's the matter?</p>

<p>DADDY TYL</p>

<p>What did I say, when we were looking at the rabbits? These two are made
for each other.... They were kissing away like anything!</p>

<p>THE NEIGHBOUR</p>

<p>Joy! Aren't you ashamed?</p>

<p>JOY</p>

<p>But, mummy....</p>

<p>DADDY TYL</p>

<p>Come, come, there's no great harm in it. We did as much, Mummy Tyl and
I, when we were young, didn't we, old lady?</p>

<p>MUMMY TYL</p>

<p>We did indeed!... They make such a pretty pair!...</p>

<p>THE NEIGHBOUR</p>

<p>That they do; but Joy is still very young and I'd like to think it over.</p>

<p>DADDY TYL</p>

<p>That's right enough.... He's very young too; but you won't find a better
boy in the whole country-side.... He's a strong, healthy lad, with a
civil tongue in his head, and he works like a nigger.... Think it over
by all means, only, as this is a holiday, there's no harm in their
kissing each other; and let's see them do it: it's good for one!...
(<i>Seeing that</i> TYLTYL <i>and</i> JOY <i>do not move, he pushes them close
together</i>.) Well?... Look at them: they don't want to now!</p>

<p>TYLTYL</p>

<p>(<i>In a whisper, to</i> JOY, <i>as he kisses her</i>.) It was better when we were
by ourselves, wasn't it?</p>

<p>JOY</p>

<p>(<i>Also whispering</i>.) Yes, it was!</p>

<p>TYLTYL</p>

<p>They were right, weren't they?</p>

<p>JOY</p>

<p>Who?</p>

<p>TYLTYL</p>

<p>The others.</p>

<p>JOY</p>

<p>Yes.</p>

<p>TYLTYL</p>

<p>Don't say a word to any one: it is our secret, yours and mine....</p>
